Hengda (Evergrande), the real estate developer that became the epicenter of China&#39;s real estate crisis when it defaulted in 2021, has filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States. The move is aimed at protecting its assets in the United States from creditors.

 According to a Reuters report on Sunday (local time), Hengda filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Protection Act in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, New York. Hengda also filed for bankruptcy protection for its subsidiary Tenhe Holdings on the same day.

 Chapter 15 is a process used to protect assets in the United States while restructuring in other countries. If the court grants Hengda bankruptcy protection, creditors will not be able to seize Hengda&#39;s U.S. assets or pursue other legal proceedings.

 In its filing, Hengda asked to recognize restructuring negotiations underway in Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands, and the British Virgin Islands, and claimed that creditors will vote on the restructuring deal this month and that it could be approved by the Hong Kong and Virgin Islands courts in the first week of next month. The bankruptcy court hearing is scheduled to take place on the 20th of next month.

<div class="article-body">
Hengda, once China&#39;s largest real estate developer, became the epicenter of the country&#39;s real estate crisis when it failed to repay bonds in late 2021. At the time, Hengda owed $22.7 billion in bonds.

 The company was subsequently suspended from trading on the Hong Kong stock market in March of last year. Hengda&#39;s debt is now estimated at $330 billion ($440 billion).

 China&#39;s real estate market was rocked by Hengda&#39;s failure to make repayments, but the crisis was largely contained as the company continued to bail out. However, since last month, other large real estate players such as Wanda, Big Guiyuan, and Yuanyang have failed to repay their bonds in quick succession, raising concerns.

 Together, they account for more than 40% of China&#39;s home sales. China&#39;s largest private real estate trust, Zhongrong Trust, which pools client money to invest in real estate, also failed to return maturing instruments this month, raising concerns that the crisis is spreading to the financial sector.
