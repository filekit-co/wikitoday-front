A sequence of strong earthquake tremors occurred today in Naples, Italy. The epicenter of the strongest tremor, with a magnitude of 3.3, was located in the Campi Flegrei area.

 The tremors were felt by residents, and as a precautionary measure, many people took to the streets. Fortunately, no personal or property damage has been reported at this time.

 According to the surveys conducted by the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (Ingv), the series of earthquake tremors began during the night between Thursday and Friday. The first tremor, with a magnitude of 2, was recorded shortly before 2 a.m. on August 18, followed by several more tremors throughout the night.

 The strongest tremor, with a magnitude of 3.3, occurred at 6.18 a.m. and was followed by another tremor of magnitude 2.8 at 6.22 a.m. The seismic events in Naples have caused fear and concern among the population.

Many residents were awakened in their sleep by the tremors, which lasted several seconds. The fear was further intensified by the fact that the earthquakes were among the strongest recorded in the past 20 years.

 Despite the strong tremors, the Civil Protection agency has reassured the public that no damage has been reported so far. They are closely monitoring the situation and are in contact with the local authorities.

 The Vesuvius Observatory has also notified the local administrations about the ongoing seismic sequence in the Campi Flegrei area. The Phlegraean Fields, where the tremors occurred, is a highly seismic area.

 It is important for residents to remain calm and refer to official channels of communication for updates and information. The authorities are working diligently to ensure the safety of the population and will provide updates as the situation unfolds.
