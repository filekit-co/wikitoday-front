Now ranked 13th in the world, Tommy Paul is undeniably closing in on the top 10. Ahead of his meeting with Carlos Alcaraz in the last 16, Tommy Paul spoke of this possibility in a statement reported by ATP.

 &#39;I think everyone&#39;s paying more attention to it than I am. It&#39;s hard not to hear it.

For example, when I arrived here, I saw Frances (Tiafoe, currently 10th, ed.), he was in the locker room and said to me: &#39;Dude, if anyone&#39;s going to take me out of the Top 10, I wanted it to be you&#39;. I thought, &#39;Man, I wasn&#39;t even thinking about that&#39;.

 Like when I played Sinner in Toronto (in the semi-finals). I had to beat him and win another match to get into the Top 10.

 I don&#39;t really think about it.&#39; As a reminder, the American has beaten Alcaraz twice in three meetings, notably in the quarter-finals in Toronto last week (6-3, 4-6, 6-3). The time for revenge has already come.
