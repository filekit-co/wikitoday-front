Lee was indicted in May last year for allegedly using undisclosed information to make 1.1 billion won in profits in someone else&#39;s name, and was sentenced to two years in prison, a fine of 2.2 billion won, and 1.1 billion won in restitution on appeal on May 11 this year. On October 6, last year, the first trial court (Seoul Southern District Court Criminal Division 11) found Lee guilty of most of the charges and sentenced him to three years in prison, five years of probation, and a fine of 3.5 billion won, citing that he returned the ill-gotten gains, but the appeals court (Seoul High Court Criminal Division 5) increased the sentence, saying that Lee&#39;s guilt was not light as he committed the crime for personal gain without considering bona fide investors, and that he was more responsible than the other defendants as the general manager and final head of the company.

 While the Supreme Court&#39;s decision will determine whether Lee will be released from prison, local business circles are expecting him to return to management, as the role of anchor company EcoPro and its affiliate EcoProViM is crucial for Chungbuk, which has been designated as a national advanced strategic business complex for secondary batteries, to become a global center for the battery industry beyond South Korea. Lee stepped down as CEO last March in connection with insider trading allegations, but remains chairman.

 The company plans to build an R&amp;D campus in Jungshin-ri, Ochang-eup, Cheongwon-gu, Cheongju-si, with a project cost of 300 billion won (about 140,000 square meters). EcoPro plans to start construction within the year and gradually move forward with joint research projects covering all areas of material research, including battery metals, precursors, cathode materials, and waste batteries, by gathering R&amp;D personnel from all family companies scattered in Cheongju and Pohang in 2024 and 2025.

The company has completed the administrative procedures, including the dedication of agricultural land, but is facing difficulties in negotiating with landowners and is unable to estimate the timing of construction. Of the total project area, 18% of the land has been secured by Ecopro, of which 15% is state-owned and only 3% is privately owned.

 Negotiations with landowners are stalled due to disagreements over compensation. An official from EcoPro explained, &#39;The compensation price was estimated by comprehensively judging the published land price, actual transaction price, and appraisal price, but it falls short of the landowners&#39; expectations.&#39; &#39;If we compensate the landowners as they demand, it may cause financial problems and affect the development of nearby industrial parks.&#39; There are also expectations that Lee&#39;s return will expedite the planned large-scale investments.

 In fact, SK Chairman Choi Tae-won, who returned to business in 2015 after being granted a special amnesty on August 15, announced plans to invest a total of 46 trillion won in SK hynix within 10 days of his release. In December 2016, SK hynix announced the construction of a state-of-the-art semiconductor factory in Cheongju, which led to the completion of the M15 factory in Cheongju in 2018.

 A local businessman said, &#39;Secondary battery is an industry that feeds not only Chungbuk but also South Korea, along with semiconductors and bio.&#39; &#39;The absence of decision-makers is a big risk in terms of national competitiveness as the competition in high-tech strategic industries is intensifying day by day.&#39;
