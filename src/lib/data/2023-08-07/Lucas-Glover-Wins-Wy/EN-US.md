Lucas Glover claimed victory at the Wyndham Championship, his first PGA Tour title in more than two years. In a thrilling final round, Glover finished with a 2-under 68 to secure a two-shot victory over Russell Henley and Byeong Hun An. The win propelled him from 112th to 49th in the FedEx Cup standings, giving him the opportunity to compete in the prestigious $20 million events next year. The timing of Glover&#39;s win was especially poignant, as it coincided with the birthday of his late grandfather, who played a crucial role in his golfing journey.
