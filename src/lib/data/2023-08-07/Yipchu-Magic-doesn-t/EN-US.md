Most of the region will be under severe heat advisory today, Lunar New Year Typhoon Kanun&#39;s path veers further west People wash their faces at Namsan Mountain in Seoul on the morning of Sept.

7, a day ahead of the Lunar New Year, but still under a heat wave. Yonhap The scorching heat is expected to persist across the country, except for Gangwon-do and the east coast of North Gyeongsang Province, during the Lunar New Year, which marks the beginning of the fall season.

Typhoon No. 6, Kanun, is expected to take a slightly more westerly course than expected and make landfall on the south coast between Gyeongnam and Jeonnam. However, Kanun&#39;s wind radius (the area with winds of 15㎧ or more) is more than 300 kilometers, so the entire country is still under its influence. The Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) forecasts that the maximum temperature will be around 30 degrees on the 8th as easterly winds enter the east coast of Gangwon-do and Gyeongbuk-do, while heat warnings will continue in most other areas.

The heat advisory is expected to be lifted on the 9th and 10th as Typhoon Kanun, the sixth typhoon in the country, brings rain across the country. As of 9 a.m. on the 9th, Kanun was moving northward in the sea south of Kagoshima, Japan, and is expected to move into the sea about 150 kilometers west of Kagoshima at 3 p.m. and pass over Kyushu. At 3 a.m. on the 10th, Kanun is expected to move offshore about 170 kilometers east of Seogwipo before making landfall 30 kilometers southwest of Tongyeong the same morning as a &#39;strong&#39; storm.

Due to Kanun&#39;s influence, a typhoon warning has been issued for the outer eastern waters of the South Sea. Strong wind warnings are in effect for Geomundo and Chodo, Jeollanam-do, and wind warnings are in effect for most of the East and South Seas. The wind advisory is expected to gradually extend to the entire sea, and is expected to change to a typhoon advisory as Kanun advances northward.

Showers due to atmospheric instability are expected in inland areas where the heat wave persists. The Korea Meteorological Administration forecast showers in southern Gyeonggi and southern Gangwon, inland Chungcheong, and southern regions (excluding the east coast of North Gyeongsang) from this afternoon to evening. In particular, rainfall is expected to reach 5 to 60 millimeters in the Jeolla and Gyeongsang regions, with up to 80 millimeters in Chungcheongnam-do and more than 100 millimeters in inland Jeolla, Gwangju, and Jeonnam-do.

In the Seoul metropolitan area and the eastern parts of Gangwon-do, Busan, Ulsan, and Gyeongnam, the expected rainfall is 5 to 40 millimeters.
