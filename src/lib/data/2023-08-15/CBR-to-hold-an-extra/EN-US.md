 Moscow. August 14.

 INTERFAX.RU - An extraordinary meeting of the Bank of Russia&#39;s board of directors will be held on Tuesday, August 15, to consider the level of the key rate, the regulator said in a statement. A press release with the decision of the Central Bank&#39;s board of directors will be published at 10:30 Moscow time.

 The scheduled meeting of the board of directors on the rate is to be held on September 15. On July 21, the Bank of Russia decided to raise the key rate by 100 basis points at once - up to 8.5% per annum.

The Central Bank said at the time that it allowed the possibility of further rate increases at the next meetings to stabilize inflation near 4% in 2024 and beyond. Traditionally, this wording means a high probability of an increase already at the next meeting, the Bank of Russia&#39;s deputy governor Alexei Zabotkin explained later.

 The euro and the US dollar were actively strengthening on the Moscow Exchange on Monday morning. The dollar rose above 101 rubles for the first time since March 23, 2022, the euro - above 111 rubles.

 The Bank of Russia said earlier on Monday that it sees no threat to financial stability from the weakening of the ruble exchange rate. The exchange rate is formed under the influence of a large number of factors.

 &#39;Along with a significant reduction in the value of exports, there is an expansion of demand for imports, associated with the active growth of domestic demand, including against the background of high rates of lending while maintaining an increased level of government demand,&#39; the Central Bank said. At the same time, the regulator stressed that monetary policy actions (MPA) will be aimed at neutralizing the effects from these factors to stabilize inflation in 2024.

 &#39;Further tightening of the MPA is required to stabilize inflation at 4%. The Bank of Russia admits the possibility of raising the key rate at its upcoming meetings,&#39; the Central Bank said on Monday.
