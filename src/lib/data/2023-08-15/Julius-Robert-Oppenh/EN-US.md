On August 6, 1945, the first atomic bomb in human history, Little Boy, was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, bringing unprecedented devastation. Three days later, another atomic bomb, Fat Man, was dropped on Nagasaki, plunging the entire country into chaos.

 These bombings, which led to Japan&#39;s surrender, were a result of the Manhattan Project, a US-led initiative to develop nuclear weapons. At the forefront of this project was Julius Robert Oppenheimer, a brilliant physicist.

 Oppenheimer, often referred to as the &#39;father of the atomic bomb,&#39; played a pivotal role in leading scientists in the development of the bomb. However, despite his involvement, he was also an opponent of the hydrogen bomb development.

 He believed that the atomic bomb&#39;s destructive power could serve as a deterrent against future wars. But as he witnessed the devastating impact of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he became haunted by the consequences of his creation.

 Born on April 22, 1904, in New York City, Oppenheimer had a remarkable academic journey. He excelled in his studies, graduating magna cum laude from Harvard University&#39;s chemistry department in just three years.

He continued his education in Europe, making a name for himself in theoretical physics. Upon his return to the United States, Oppenheimer became a renowned professor.

 Oppenheimer&#39;s life took a political turn during the Great Depression. While he did not join the Communist Party, his associations and leftist leanings raised suspicions during the McCarthy era.

 In 1953, after a humiliating hearing, he lost his security clearance. Despite his significant contributions to science and his complex legacy, Oppenheimer&#39;s story did not end with his death.

 In 2022, he was posthumously cleared of being a Soviet spy, a label that had haunted him for decades. Today, Oppenheimer&#39;s life and the moral dilemmas he faced continue to captivate audiences.

 Director Christopher Nolan has brought Oppenheimer&#39;s story to the big screen with his film &#39;Oppenheimer.&#39; Through this cinematic experience, viewers can delve into the struggles and contradictions of a man who changed the course of history with his scientific achievements.
