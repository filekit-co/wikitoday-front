Delayed deliveries and out-of-stock notices amid a sales surge 'Protect your body' anxiety spreads An online store is out of tridents. Shopping Mall Nurijip Galmuri 'Sales of self-defense products have been surging recently due to the ongoing serious incidents...We will do our best to deliver them as quickly as possible and hope that you will never have to use them, as our company motto says.' On the 4th, NAVER Smart Store, which sells self-defense products, posted a message about the delay in delivery. The three-piece baton, which costs 15,900 won, has over 8,100 reviews. 'I bought it for self-defense after seeing a vicious post about a murder in broad daylight,' most of them said. On March 3, 13 days after the stabbing in Shinlim-dong, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, another indiscriminate crime occurred at a department store near Seohyeon Station in Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, and the number of consumers seeking self-defense products has surged. The news that the police have launched an investigation into the crime, with a series of warning posts on large communities, is also amplifying consumers' anxiety. Some products are even selling out. A sign for a company selling self-defense products.

Nurijip Galmuri According to G-market, sales of self-defense products increased by 243 percent from March 22 to March 3 compared to the same period last year. Sales of truncheons for self-defense increased by 303%. On 11th Avenue, sales of self-defense products and self-defense sprays increased by 109% and 171%, respectively, compared to the same period last year. 'After the stabbing in Shinlim-dong on the 21st of last month, people who were overwhelmed by the anxiety of 'what could happen to me' were buying a lot of related products to protect themselves,' said an industry insider. 'In addition, the Seohyun Station incident every three days is expected to cause a further surge in self-defense product sales.' In fact, on the fourth day after the Seohyun Station incident, 'self-defense products' ranked at the top of the Naver Shopping search chart. Kubotan is popular among women. There were over 1,300 reviews. Nurijip Galmuri 'When I go to the bathroom, take the train, or walk down the street, I find myself constantly looking around, and I'm sensitive to the slightest sound,' said Yoo Ah-moo-gae, a woman in her 40s who lives in Seongbuk-gu, Seoul. 'In a chat room with my family, we discussed whether we should all buy self-defense products.' Another man in his 30s, Yoon Ah-moo-gae, said, 'The stabbing incident made me realize that women who are relatively weak are not the only ones who become victims.' 'I'm thinking of buying a lightweight spray, a trident, or a kubotan (a keychain with a pointed end) for self-defense,' he said.
