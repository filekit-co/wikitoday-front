Gyeongsangbuk-do is taking action through the Landslide Response System Innovation Task Force, saying the heavy rains have shown that there are no safe zones. It plans to build disaster prevention villages that can prevent landslides, and will begin a large-scale safety diagnosis of risk factors such as artificial objects in the mountains. In addition, we will improve the warning, evacuation, and rescue and relief systems so that rapid dissemination and evacuation can be carried out in actual situations. With extreme weather events such as extreme downpours becoming an everyday occurrence, the extent of the damage will depend on how well we establish permanent recovery plans and disaster preparedness.
