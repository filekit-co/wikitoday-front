## '50 billion club' Park Young-soo arrested...What's the difference from when he was dismissed a month ago?

_2023-08-05 - wikitoday_

Former special prosecutor Park Young-soo, who is under suspicion of the so-called '5 billion club' for receiving money in exchange for helping private developers in Daejeon-dong, heads to court to appear for his second pre-arrest interrogation (warrant examination) at the Seoul Central District Court in Seocho-gu, Seoul, on Wednesday morning. Yonhap An arrest warrant for former special prosecutor Park Young-soo, which the court had dismissed once, was issued on Wednesday. Park is considered one of the members of the '5 billion club' that allegedly received lobbying from a private businessman in Daegu-dong. Additional charges filed by prosecutors in the course of the reinforcement investigation are believed to have made the difference. Yoon Jae-nam, deputy chief judge of the Seoul Central District Court's warrant division, announced the reason for issuing an arrest warrant for Park on the night of March 3, saying that 'there is a risk of evidence being destroyed.' Normally, an arrest warrant is issued on the premise that the charges have been partially proven and for reasons such as evidence destruction and fear of escape. Previously, in June, Chief Warrant Officer Yoo Chang-hoon dismissed the arrest warrant, saying that the charges were 'disputed in factual and legal terms' and did not recognize the charges themselves. The prosecution believes the new charges, which were filed in a reinforced investigation, helped reverse the outcome. Prosecutors added the charge of violating the anti-graft law, alleging that 1.1 billion won of the money Park was supposed to receive went to her daughter, Park Ah-moo-gae, in the form of loans while she was a special prosecutor. The prosecution claimed that private businesses in Daejeon-dong promised to pay Park, and that the promise was realized in the 1.1 billion won that went to Park's daughter, which the court accepted.

Park's destruction of her cell phone earlier this year is also believed to have contributed to the court's determination of 'evidence destruction concerns.' New evidence obtained during the reinforcement investigation also played a role. During the reinforcement investigation, the prosecution obtained a loan agreement stating that Kim Man-bae, the majority shareholder of Hwacheon Daewoo Asset Management, borrowed 500 million won from Park, and that Park was to receive the money back in shares. The document served to support the allegation that Park had agreed to receive money. 'After carefully analyzing the reasons for dismissing the warrant, we reinforced the evidence with solid evidence and explained it in detail to the court,' said an official from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. Park has previously stated that she 'did not receive or promise anything in exchange for participating in the Daejeon-dong development project or arranging financing.' The detention of Park is expected to speed up the rest of the '5 billion club' investigation. In particular, the investigation of former Nationalist Party of Korea lawmaker Kwak Sang-do, whose case is similarly structured in that he realized the money he was to receive through his children, is likely to gain momentum. Prosecutors called Kwak's son, Kwak Sang-do, who received 5 billion won in severance pay (2.5 billion won in error) from Hwacheon Daewoo, for questioning on the 27th of last month and again earlier this week. A prosecution official said on March 3, 'We plan to investigate the alleged '5 billion club' in a sequential manner.' Former Supreme Court Justice Kwon Soon-il, who is suspected of 'trial transactions,' is also being investigated. By Kwang-joon Jeon light@hani.co.kr
