UFC bantamweight fighter &#39;Mr. Perfect&#39; Kang Kyung-ho (35) predicted Lee Chang-ho (29)&#39;s entry into the UFC. &#39;I think Lee Chang-ho will win the &#39;Road to UFC&#39; with his sticky grappling,&#39; he predicted.

 Lee Chang-ho will face Daelmis Jaufas (23, China) in the bantamweight semifinals of &#39;Road to UFC Season 2&#39; at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Nov. 27 (KST).

 Road to UFC is a quarterfinal tournament where Asia&#39;s top prospects compete for a UFC contract. The semifinals will culminate fight week with UFC Fight Night: Holloway vs.

 Korean Zombie on Nov. 26 at the same venue.

<div class="article-body">
Lee has a long history of relentlessly taking opponents to the ground and attacking with ground-and-pound from top position. It&#39;s been nicknamed &#39;ant hell&#39; because once he&#39;s caught, there&#39;s no escaping.

 That&#39;s why 11-year UFC veteran Kyung Ho Kang is picking Lee to win. Speaking about the semifinal, he said, &#39;I&#39;m really excited for this fight because both Lee Chang Ho and Daelmis Jaufas showed great ground games in the quarterfinals.

 I think it&#39;s going to come down to a ground fight, but I think Lee&#39;s ground game is stronger and he&#39;ll win.&#39; Lee is a well-rounded fighter with a knack for striking. Former UFC bantamweight fighter Takeya Mizugaki (39, Japan), who now works as a UFC commentator in Japan, agrees, saying, &#39;Lee Chang-ho is a well-rounded fighter and he will have the advantage in striking against Darmis Zaupas.&#39; He predicts that Lee will reach the final.

 However, he also analyzed that the fight could be decided on the ground, saying, &#39;If Lee Chang-ho doesn&#39;t have the advantage in striking, the fight will be interesting.&#39; Launched last year, ROAD TO UFC has produced seven UFC contractors, including Park Hyun-sung, 27, and Lee Jung-young, 27, and has become a clear pathway for Asian mixed martial arts (MMA) prospects to enter the UFC. Kang Kyung-ho said, &#39;In the past, the pathway to the UFC was not clear.

 But now, with tournaments being held on a regular basis, it provides motivation for fighters and a lot of entertainment for Asian fans,&#39; said Kang.
