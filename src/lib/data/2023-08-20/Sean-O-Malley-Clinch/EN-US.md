Sean O’Malley has stunned the UFC world to defeat Aljamain Sterling and become the new bantamweight champion. A brutal right hand early in the second round from O’Malley dropped the champ and sent the crowd at the TD Garden into raptures.

 Sterling remained active whilst on his back as O’Malley attempted to close out the bout. Eventually the crowd favourite found an opening while Sterling was on the ground and unleashed a barrage of strikes, forcing referee Marc Goddard to step in and wave off the contest.

 UFC commentator Joe Rogan questioned whether it was perhaps a slightly early stoppage from Goddard given Sterling was still moving, but many others felt it was a wise call from Goddard to stop the fight when he did. The stoppage came after a relatively pedestrian first round in which both fighters looked to feel one another out before ramping up the intensity.

But it was the challenger who struck first and dealt the killer blow to become a UFC champion for the first time. O’Malley was ecstatic with the victory and already had his sights set on his next opponent.

 “Did Chito (Vera) win?” O’Malley asked in his post-fight interview. “Was it boring?

 Probably. “I want Chito’s a** in December in (Las) Vegas at the T-Mobile Arena.” It would be a rematch of their bout from August 2020 when Vera won via TKO after one of his kicks left O’Malley with a dead leg and practically unable to move.

 As for Sterling, he conceded he must do plenty of soul-searching after the loss but was still full of praise for his rival in a classy interview.
