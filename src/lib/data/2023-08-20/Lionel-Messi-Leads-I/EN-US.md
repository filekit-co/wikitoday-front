On Sunday, Lionel Messi became the most successful player in history, with 44 trophies, by winning the Leagues Cup with Inter Miami, in a final that the Florida club won on penalties. He thus equals Dani Alves, whose trophy tally is a little hazy.

 Yet another record for Lionel Messi. By scoring and beating Nashville on penalties in Sunday&#39;s Leagues Cup final (1-1, 10/9 tab), Lionel Messi secured the 44th title of his career and the first in Inter Miami&#39;s short history.

The Argentine international thus equals or surpasses the number of trophies won by Brazilian Dani Alves, according to conflicting counts. In less than a month at Inter Miami, Messi has radically transformed the dynamic of a team in decline and led them to a miraculous run with Sunday&#39;s Leagues Cup triumph over Nashville (1-1, 9-10 on penalties).

 The very first title for the club founded by David Beckham three years ago.
