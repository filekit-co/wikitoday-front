The road for Nashville to reach the final The Six Strings are on the brink of their first title, and this is the path they have had to travel.

 Score updates in Leagues Cup Final Nashville SC hosts Lionel Messi&#39;s Inter Miami in the Leagues Cup final at GEODIS Park.

 Follow for live score updates. Nashville SC score updates vs.

 Lionel Messi and Inter Miami in Leagues Cup final Saturday, Nashville SC goes for its biggest win of all time against maybe the greatest player of all time.

 Nashville SC hosts Lionel Messi and Inter Miami in the Leagues Cup final, which kicks off at 8 p.m. at GEODIS Park. The winner also will secure automatic passage to the CONCACAF Champions League round of 16.

 Second-half goals by Sam Surridge and Fafa Picault boosted Nashville to a 2-0 win over C.F. Monterrey in Tuesday&#39;s semifinal, putting it on the verge of its first-ever major trophy. Messi, a seven-time Ballon d&#39;Or winner and reigning World Cup champion with Argentina, has scored nine goals in six Leagues Cup games with Inter Miami since joining the team in mid-July.

 He has not played an MLS game yet with Inter Miami, which is in last place in the MLS Eastern Conference. Inter Miami defeated the Philadelphia Union 4-1 in its semifinal.

 Anibal Godoy scores. 3-2 Inter Miami.

 Second round: Sergio Busquets scores. Randall Leal saved.

 2-1 Inter Miami. Best-of-five.

 Leal tried to beat Callander in the middle. Panicco way too eager to pick a side.

 Needs composure. First round: Lionel Messi scores.

 Hany Mukhtar scores. 1-1.

 90+3&#39; ‚Äî Off some volleys following the corner (and a save by Drake Callander on a point-blank Surridge header), Miami&#39;s Leonardo Campana is all alone, tries to chip Panicco, does so to beat the keeper but cannot get it into the net. How.

 That was the final action of regulation. Look at this stuff.

 How did it stay out? WHAT JUST HAPPENED?! ü§Ø pic.twitter.com/1oWsikLLzk ‚Äî Major League Soccer (@MLS) August 20, 2023

 Penalties upcoming. 90+2&#39; ‚Äî Mukhtar gets his best look at goal of the night, and it&#39;s just saved.

 Corner... 89&#39; ‚Äî You just felt like Nashville was allowing Miami to possess, waiting for a counter attack.

That&#39;s what happens, and Mukhtar is fouled juuuust before clearing the Inter Miami defense. Yellow shown to Victor Ulloa.

 83&#39; ‚Äî Randall Leal is on for Alex Muyl. Mukhtar fouled in free kick shot attempt range....

 and the free kick goes just wide of goal. 81&#39; ‚Äî Robert Taylor and Dixon Arroyo out, David Ruiz and Victor Ulloa in.

 Miami pushing for PKs? 77&#39; ‚Äî Mukhtar on the break, lays it off for Surridge, whose shot is saved.

 Rebound goes to Mukhtar, whose shot is deflected out for a corner. 75&#39; ‚Äî Nashville now sitting back a bit as Inter Miami possesses some more in the attacking half.

 Will Messi get another chance in regulation? 71&#39; ‚Äî Messi&#39;s low shot clangs off the right post.

 Stuns the crowd. Nashville changes upcoming, with Jacob Shaffelburg and Sean Davis coming on.

 Dax McCarty and Fafa Picault coming off. Inches away from another Messi strike.

 üëÄ Still even at 1-1.

 Catch the finale on #MLSSeasonPass: https://t.co/zMquhP1RY8 pic.twitter.com/IhUCg2Dqo7 ‚Äî Major League Soccer (@MLS) August 20, 2023 67&#39; ‚Äî Shaq Moore&#39;s shot from the edge of the box is right at the Inter Miami keeper.

 Miami making changes. Josef Martinez and Benjamin Cremaschi out, Leonardo Campana and Diego Gomez in.

 66&#39; ‚Äî Mukhtar continues to try to make runs through the Miami centerbacks, but the connection and timing hasn&#39;t been there yet. The opportunity is.

 64&#39; ‚Äî Miami hasn&#39;t had a ton of chances in this match outside of the Messi strike. Nashville has been very structured.

 Both teams will certainly need to consider changes soon. 61&#39; ‚Äî GEODIS Park is at full voice.

 57&#39; ‚Äî GOAL! Off a corner from Mukhtar, Surridge&#39;s header is left for Fafa Picault on the far post. A deflection or two later, this game is 1-1.

 54&#39; ‚Äî Sergio Busquets&#39; acting as both he and Anibal Godoy slide for a ball ends up producing a yellow card by the official to Godoy. Not sure about that.

 50&#39; ‚Äî Josef Martinez shot attempt blocked by Zimmerman. 46&#39; ‚Äî Back underway.

 No changes. HALFTIME ‚Äî Inter Miami leads 1-0 on the Messi goal, but Nashville was on the doorstep throughout the final 10 minutes.

 Miami&#39;s bunkered-down defense will continue to be tested. 40&#39; ‚Äî A Surridge header is cleared away by Jordi Alba.

 Inter Miami defense is bunkering well, but it feels like Nashville gets something soon. 39&#39; ‚Äî Nashville getting good possession, but the quality not there yet.

 Couple corners have not threatened, either. 34&#39; ‚Äî Jordi Alba getting some treatment before a Nashville corner.

 29&#39; ‚Äî The crowd noise level has tapered a bit, but the supporters sections are trying to rally. Nashville SC not getting clean looks when possessing the ball in the attacking third.

 23&#39; ‚Äî it&#39;s a goal, and it&#39;s Messi. He doesn&#39;t need much room, and after dribbling past Walker Zimmerman, he deposited the curling shot into the top left corner.

 Messi knew it was a goal right away, too. That&#39;s his 10th of the tournament.

 Inter Miami 1, Nashville SC 0. Out of this WORLD.

 üí´ Take a bow, Leo Messi.

 pic.twitter.com/qm90VJtVbc ‚Äî Major League Soccer (@MLS) August 20, 2023 21&#39; ‚Äî Panicco saves a Robert Taylor shot with some pace on it.

 Inter Miami getting more of the game now. Jordi Alba is starting to make his mark off the left.

 13&#39; ‚Äî Shaq Moore has the match&#39;s first shot from outside the box. A bit wide, but a decent shout.

 Both teams feeling the other out, though Nashville&#39;s high press has muddied Miami&#39;s possession so far. 3&#39; ‚Äî Anibal Godoy chastised by the head official after giving Messi a little extra after Messi passed the ball off.

 Nothing there. 1&#39; ‚Äî Coming up!

 Pretty good rendition of the National Anthem by Colbie Caillat. Gary Smith, with Apple TV pregame, says Nashville SC must start well.

 He also praises the GEODIS Park atmosphere. Both teams have taken the field ‚Äî Inter Miami, from what I heard, received a healthy dose of boos out of the tunnel.

 #everyonen #LeaguesCupFinal pic.twitter.com/2eOiLbT6Ua ‚Äî Jacob Shames (@Jacob_Shames) August 20, 2023 The Inter Miami minority shareholder has been the face of Inter Miami&#39;s ownership group.

 That&#39;s Giannis Antetokounmpo, part of the Nashville SC ownership group. No surprise, but Lionel Messi is in the lineup tonight for Inter Miami.

 Kickoff in about an hour at GEODIS Park. Some changes in the starting XI, none more notable than Sam Surridge getting his first Nashville SC start.

 Elliot Panicco in goal. Fafa Picault in the lineup for Jacob Shaffelburg, who was injured on Tuesday but is available on the bench.
