One tournament played, one title. That&#39;s Lionel Messi&#39;s tally so far in his new spell in US soccer.

 The Argentine star, who won his first title with Inter Miami, has become the winningest player in the history of the sport, but he can&#39;t boast about one thing: he has won every championship he has played in at least once. This is Paris Saint-Germain&#39;s &#39;fault&#39;, as the only tournament Messi failed to win as a player was the French Cup, which he played in during his two seasons with the Parisians.

 Both campaigns, incidentally, ended in the same way: elimination in the round of 16. In 2021/22, Nice lost on penalties.

Then there was a defeat in normal time to Marseille the following season. Messi played in both matches and failed to be decisive.

 For the rest of his career, the star won at least once in every competition he played in. He won 35 trophies as a Barcelona player, from local (LaLiga, Copa del Rey, and Spanish Super Cup) to international (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Super Cup, and Club World Cup).

 Messi also won three titles for PSG, all domestic (Ligue 1 and the French Super Cup). With the national team, Messi won the Copa America, Finalissima, and is vying for the World Cup title in 2022.

 Now, at Inter Miami, Messi has the opportunity to add another unprecedented title to his collection: the US Open Cup.
