## China's Economy Facing Crisis: Implications of 279.7% and 46.5% Indicators

_2023-08-03 - wikitoday_

There is growing concern about China's economy, with predictions of a crisis and deflation. The severity of the situation is reflected in the indicators, particularly the Chinese government's debt. Various estimates suggest that the national debt stands at around 279% to 297%, significantly higher than the government's official data. This alarming level of debt has been driven by the government's desperate efforts to stimulate economic growth. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, China's government debt was only around 60%. One major issue is that nearly 100% of China's government debt is held by local governments, which have been heavily reliant on real estate development for revenue. However, with the recent decline in the real estate market, local governments have struggled to service their debt. In 2022, real estate revenue accounted for 21% of local government revenue in China, with provinces like Tianjin and Jilin experiencing significant declines of 62% and 61% respectively. The impact of the real estate market extends beyond revenue. It constitutes a quarter of China's GDP and its stagnation has resulted in decreased consumption. While the rest of the world is grappling with inflation, China has managed to maintain a 0% inflation rate, as its citizens are not spending enough to drive inflation. Another alarming indicator is the youth unemployment rate, which stands at 46.5% according to Professor Zhang Dandan of Peking University. While the Chinese government reports an official urban youth unemployment rate of 21.3%, the actual figure is much higher. Furthermore, the job market for recent college graduates is extremely competitive, with only about 50% of them able to find employment.

These economic challenges have the potential to lead to a youth bulge, where a large number of young people face limited job prospects, fueling social discontent and possible protests. However, it is difficult to predict whether this will escalate into a second Tiananmen Square incident. Many Chinese youth, despite their discontent and bleak prospects, exhibit a social phenomenon characterized by fear of social interaction and a rejection of societal expectations. They prioritize personal satisfaction over financial success, often spending their time engrossed in their smartphones and leading a leisurely lifestyle. Externally, China is also facing obstacles. Its traditional strengths, such as exports and foreign investment, are declining. Countries like Vietnam are attracting foreign investment that would previously have gone to China. Additionally, the dominance of the United States in semiconductors and advanced technologies presents a challenge for China's ambitions in high-tech industries beyond manufacturing. Despite these challenges, China's potential cannot be disregarded, given its large population and strong manufacturing capabilities. If domestic incomes rise and consumption is supported, China has the potential to drive economic development through domestic demand. However, achieving this potential is contingent on appropriate political leadership. China's Communist Party, with its immense membershipbase, must acknowledge the current economic situation and devise strategies to address it. China needs leaders like Deng Xiaoping, who facilitated its economic transformation in the past. While the concerns for China's economy are valid, the potential impact on South Korea, given their economic interdependence, is also a cause for concern.
