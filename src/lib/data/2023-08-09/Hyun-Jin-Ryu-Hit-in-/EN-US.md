8 (KST), but was hit by a hard pitch in the bottom of the fourth inning and did not return to the mound until the top of the fifth. Before being pulled, Ryu had pitched four scoreless innings with one hit, one walk and two strikeouts. His velocity was up compared to his first start in 14 months against the Baltimore Orioles on April 2, and his changeup looked steady, so he was hoping to get his first win of the season.

 Fortunately, it appears to be a simple bruise and he should be able to make his next start.
