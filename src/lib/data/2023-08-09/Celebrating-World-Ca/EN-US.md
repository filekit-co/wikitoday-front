August 8 is World Cat Day. It was first created by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) in 2002 to raise awareness of cats around the world. The day aims to highlight the importance of cats in our lives and to promote their well-being.

 Cats have been domesticated and lived with humans for thousands of years, and they hold a special place in many cultures and mythologies. In ancient Egypt, cats were revered as gods and were even mummified and buried with their owners. In Greece and Rome, cats were valued for their ability to control pests.
