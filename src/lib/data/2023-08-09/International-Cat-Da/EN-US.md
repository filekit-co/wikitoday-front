It&#39;s International Cat Day: Here are 5 weird things your cat is doing and why. They&#39;re furry and cute. Curious and playful.

Affectionate and (alright, yes), sometimes act like fluffy little monsters. We love cats for a variety of reasons and experts say it&#39;s a good thing we do. A feline companion can boost your health, according to medical researchers, who found cat ownership eases stress and may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Anyone who&#39;s been nuzzled by a purring kitten after a long, hard day at work knows what a difference that makes. While cats are amazing, at times their behavior is a mystery. This Tuesday, Aug.

8, is International Cat Day. To celebrate, here are five things your feline friend might be doing and what they mean. Cats have a reputation for being affectionate one moment, and ferocious beasts the next.

Take the classic example of when your feline rolls over and exposes its belly, as if asking for a tummy rub. Touch that tummy though and you might get bit. Why?

Experts say it&#39;s because cats are giving us a statement, not an invitation. “When cats expose their bellies to us, they are saying they trust us. But when we take them up on this ‘offer’ by rubbing their bellies, they may retract it with a bite or a scratch, as it was only meant as a form of communication,” said Sam Meisler, DVM, a veterinarian and founder of PetWellClinic in an article by Reader&#39;s Digest.

If you&#39;ve ever Googled, &#39;Why is my cat not using its litterbox?&#39; or &#39;How to get the smell of cat pee out of a couch,&#39; we feel for you. Dealing with stained furniture is frustrating and you might be wondering if your cat secretly hates you. Experts say this behavior is unusual for felines, and could be caused by several underlying reasons, which include:

A urinary tract infection. Kidney problems. Stress.

A dirty litterbox. New and unfamiliar litter. A new pet is in the house and the cat is trying to establish dominance.

Should your cat do its business outside the litterbox, consider bringing it to the vet as quickly as possible to ensure your pet isn&#39;t suffering from a serious medical condition. Also, clean your cat&#39;s litterbox daily. Your cat will thank you — so too will your sofa.

If cats could buy presents for us from Amazon to show their love, they totally would. It might be an odd gift, like a new scratching post, but it&#39;s the thought that counts, right? Just as couples will occasionally give each other flowers or drop off a delicious plate of tacos, cats will sometimes bring things to the table: dead things.

Experts say when your well-meaning feline presents you with a bird or mouse it caught and killed, don&#39;t scold it. Cats carry food to a place they feel secure, which is a compliment, and sometimes they want to share that meal with family — namely you. A kitty wrapped in a blanket is adorable, especially when they &#39;make biscuits&#39; or knead on the blanket&#39;s fuzzy material.

While conventional wisdom suggests a cat is returning to its more kitten-like roots, there are other suggestions for why this behavior happens, according to DiscerningCat.com. Some reasons why cats chew and knead on blankets are because: It&#39;s a territorial thing.

Cat paws have scent glands that will mark the blanket as their own. It&#39;s instinctual. That&#39;s what your cat used to do to nurse.

It&#39;s soothing. They might be feeling stressed or nervous. Be mindful that your cat isn&#39;t tearing pieces off the blanket and eating them.

If that happens, contact your veterinarian&#39;s office. Cats will sometimes eat materials they shouldn&#39;t if they&#39;re overly stressed, bored or lonely. Cats show affection in many ways.

One of them is by grooming each other, which includes grooming you. They tend to be clean animals, so if a cat cuddles up beside you and starts to lick your skin, take it as a compliment: they&#39;re showing you that they care. Other reasons your cat might start licking you is because they&#39;re lonely, according to PetHelpful.com, which means you should probably give them some additional attention and &#39;groom them back&#39; using a brush or by giving them a few extra chin scritches.
