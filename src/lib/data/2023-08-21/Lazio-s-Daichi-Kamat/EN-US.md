The first Serie A matchup between Lazio and Lecce took place on January 20. Lecce, a promoted team, won the Serie A title last season with an organized defense.

 Lazio, on the other hand, finished second in Serie A last season and earned the right to challenge for the Champions League for the first time in three years. Japanese midfielder Daichi Kamata, who joined Lazio from Frankfurt in the summer transfer window, made his debut in this match.

Kamata, who has been attracting attention as a replacement for Serbian midfielder Sergej Milinkovic Savic, showcased his skills by scoring a goal in a preseason match. Although Lazio lost the match to Lecce, Kamata&#39;s performance demonstrated his adaptation to Maurizio Sarri&#39;s attacking style of play, also known as &#39;Sarri Ball&#39;.

 Despite not being in perfect condition, Kamata played until the 55th minute and showed promise. Lazio will have another chance to bounce back in their upcoming match against Genoa.
