The Indian cricket team has revealed its squad for the Asia Cup 2023. There is a major change in the 17-member squad, with star spinner Yuzvendra Chahal not being included.

 Instead, all-rounder Axar Patel has been given the opportunity. Meanwhile, chinaman spinner Kuldeep Yadav has been included as the main spinner.

 Ravindra Jadeja will also be seen in the spin department. With only three spinners in the 17-member Indian squad, it will be interesting to see how successful this plan is.

Chahal has not been getting much attention from India in major tournaments. If he is part of the squad, he is usually kept away from the playing eleven.

 However, recently Chahal has been struggling to make an impact. In the recent T20 series against West Indies, he took 5 wickets in five matches.

 But he has not been selected for the Asia Cup.
