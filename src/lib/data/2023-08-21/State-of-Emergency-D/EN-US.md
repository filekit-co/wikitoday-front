Samet Kaplan, who went to France where he lives after his annual leave, told AA correspondent that he started his return after 2 months of leave but encountered a setback. Kaplan said that the officials at Ipsala Border Gate stated that there was a huge fire in Greece and directed them to Pazarkule and added, &#39;There is a density here as well.

 God willing, we will be safe and sound. Normally I always go via Ipsala, but it will be 200 kilometers longer from here.

 Since the highway is closed in Greece, maybe we will continue our journey through the cities. A fire broke out yesterday evening in the forest in the Melia region of Alexandroupoli, Greece.

 The fire is being fought from the air and on the ground. Due to the fire, which can also be seen in Enes district, all roads on the Greek side connected to the Ipsala Border Gate were closed to traffic.

 The Ministry of Trade warned those who want to use the Ipsala Customs Gate, which was closed to crossings due to the fire in Greece, and said, &#39;Additional measures were taken by our Ministry for the entry and exit demands that are expected to increase at our Pazarkule, Kapıkule, Hamzabeyli and Dereköy customs gates.&#39; Edirne Governorate shared the following statements on its social media account;

*We have been informed that all roads on the Greek side connected to our Ipsala Border Gate are closed to traffic due to the ongoing fires in Greece. *For this reason, exits from our Ipsala Border Gate have been suspended until further notice.

 After the closure of the gate, those who wanted to cross to Greece headed to Pazarkule Border Gate. Many people, including expatriates, who wanted to cross to Greece formed a density at Pazarkule for crossing.

 Thousands of acres of pine forests in the Southern Evros region were burned down, 9 houses and a church were completely burned and many buildings were damaged due to the fire that started yesterday in Alexandroupoli. The fire caused serious damage to agricultural fields, beehives and livestock in the region.

 12 settlements in the region were evacuated as a precautionary measure. The Feres-Dedeağaç road was closed to traffic for security reasons.

 In Alexandroupoli city center, authorities urged people to stay indoors with their windows closed to avoid being affected by the heavy smoke. Eight firefighters and a volunteer were injured while fighting the fire.

 The injured were taken under treatment at Alexandroupoli State Hospital. The firefighting efforts, in which the Greek Police, Armed Forces and volunteers also support the fire brigade, continue on the ground and from the air, but the strong winds in the region make it difficult to extinguish the fire.
