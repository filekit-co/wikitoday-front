ZVC JAPAN, the Japanese subsidiary of Zoom Video Communications (Zoom), announced that the Imuraya Group has integrated its internal communications infrastructure with Zoom solutions and is focusing on using UCaaS (Unified Communications as a Service). Imuraya Group began using Zoom Meetings around 2018 to create an environment for communication both inside and outside the company.

 In 2020, the company switched to &#39;Zoom Phone,&#39; a cloud PBX, when the telephone switchboard was replaced, thereby reducing construction and maintenance costs and creating an environment that allows employees to answer calls to the office even outside the office. They also switched their internal chat tool to &#39;Zoom Team Chat&#39; in the same year.
