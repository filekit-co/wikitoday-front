 Brokerage CLSA noted that other than a stake in RIL, liquids worth $2.5 billion or Rs 33 a piece have been demerged into JFS. This can support a loan book of $13-15 billion, said the foreign brokerage, which noted that even at the speed of the recent annual loan book additions of sector leader Bajaj Finance, JFS will take nearly three years to fully use up the amount.

 Most lending financials trade below 3 times price to book ratio, except Bajaj Finance and Chola, which have return ratios of over 20 per cent. This, CLSA said, will need a PAT of over $500 million for core Jio Finance Services.
