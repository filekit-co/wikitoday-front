  <p>The main consequence of hysterectomy is the inability to get pregnant. The patient also stops menstruating, but if the ovaries are preserved, she will still have part of her menstrual cycle and ovulate normally. Other possible consequences include loss of libido, lubrication, or pain during sexual intercourse.</p>

<div class="article-body">
The procedure to remove the uterus can be partial or total and is indicated for women with serious problems in the pelvic region, such as cervical cancer at an advanced stage. Singer Preta Gil spoke out for the first time this Sunday (20) after undergoing surgery to remove a tumor that included a total abdominal hysterectomy.

 A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the uterus, which can also include the removal of the cervix. The surgery can be classified as partial or total, also known as radical.

 According to experts, the procedure is usually indicated for women with serious problems in the pelvic region, such as cervical cancer, ovarian cancer at an advanced stage, infections, fibroids, bleeding, severe endometriosis, and uterine prolapse. In some cases, doctors may choose to remove the uterus as a form of protection, especially in oncological situations where there are invasions of some pelvic vessels.
