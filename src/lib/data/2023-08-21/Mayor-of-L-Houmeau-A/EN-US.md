The Radical Party mayor of L&#39;Houmeau (Charente-Maritime), Jean-Luc Algay, was violently molested on Saturday in his commune, as revealed by the newspaper Sud Ouest. While attempting to oppose the illegal installation of Travellers on the municipal stadium, the mayor was taken to task by a group of individuals from the community.

 One of them even &#39;belted him, first in the face, then in the chest&#39;, recounts the local politician in the regional daily. After receiving a barrage of blows, Jean-Luc Algay finally escaped with a slightly cracked rib and 10 days&#39; sick leave.

 According to Sud Ouest, the mayor has lodged a complaint with the gendarmerie. In this commune near La Rochelle, a farmer had already threatened the mayor, on March 22, to &#39;sequester him in his town hall&#39; after several local disagreements between farmers and the local politician.

But the situation never escalated into violence. The attack on the mayor of L&#39;Houmeau joins a long list of local councillors molested by their constituents.

 In Sagy (Val-d&#39;Oise), DVD mayor Guy Paris was beaten by around twenty individuals on Wednesday August 16, when he too prevented the illegal installation of travellers in his commune. Against a backdrop of increasingly difficult working conditions, town councillors have repeatedly warned of the risk of a major resignation.

 After launching a plan to better protect these elected officials on May 19, Dominique Faure, the French Minister for Local Authorities, recently announced an increase in the compensation paid to mayors of small communes, &#39;commensurate with their commitment&#39;.
