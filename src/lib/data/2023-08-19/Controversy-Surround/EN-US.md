<div class="article-body">
The participation of rapper Médine in the Europe Écologie-Les Verts (EELV) Summer Days has stirred up controversy and sparked outrage among various groups, including members of the ecologist party itself. Médine has faced accusations of making anti-Semitic remarks, particularly when he referred to Jewish essayist Rachel Khan as a &#39;resKHANpée&#39;, the granddaughter of a deportee.

 Despite the backlash and concerns raised, Médine is still scheduled to participate in a debate in Le Havre with Marine Tondelier, the national secretary of the French Green Party, on August 24. The decision to invite Médine to the event has drawn criticism from several members of EELV, but it has found support from Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the Insoumis party.

 Mélenchon defended Médine against allegations of racism and rebuked certain members of EELV for their opposition. He emphasized that Médine is not racist and questioned the motives behind trying to impose positions on him that he does not hold, especially after he was invited to the event.

 Mélenchon accused his opponents within EELV of being submissive to the hypocritical opinions of others. However, there are ecologists who express their indignation regarding Médine&#39;s participation in the event.

Karima Delli, an ecologist MEP, stated that she cannot support or condone Médine&#39;s invitation due to her strong attachment to values such as respect for people, freedom, equality, solidarity, and secularism. Sandrine Rousseau, another prominent member of EELV, called for Médine to acknowledge the anti-Semitic nature of his remarks about Rachel Khan.

 On the other hand, Marine Tondelier pledged to be extremely attentive to Médine&#39;s statements during the debate at the Summer Days of the ecologists. The controversy surrounding Médine&#39;s invitation has further fueled the ongoing debate within the ecologist formation, with people taking different positions on the issue.

 The division within the party has become more pronounced, as some members refuse to accept the rapper&#39;s participation, while others defend his presence in these politically charged events. The discussion reflects the differing perspectives and opinions within the ecologist movement.
