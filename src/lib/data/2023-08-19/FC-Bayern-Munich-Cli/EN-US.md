FC Bayern Munich won a respectable opening match to the 61st season of the Bundesliga against a SV Werder that was resistant for a long time. The record champions from Munich won 4-0 after a convincing performance at Weserstadion on Friday night (18.08.2023).

 Leroy Sané provided the first goal of the new Bundesliga season, the international scored as early as the 3rd minute to give Munich the lead. Record newcomer Harry Kane ensured the preliminary decision with his first goal in the Bayern dress (74th).

 Sané with his second goal (90th) and Mathys Tel (90.+4) increased the score to 4:0 in the closing minutes. The team of coach Ole Werner was able to keep the game open for a long time, but had nothing more to offer to the overall dominant FC Bayern in the final phase.

 The Bremen team thus continued its horror series against the team of coach Thomas Tuchel. It set the 15th home defeat in a row in the sold-out Weserstadion with 42,100 spectators against the Munich, the last Werder victory in the direct comparison is now almost 15 years ago.

 The Bayern coach was satisfied with the reaction of the team after the sobering 0:3 in the Supercup against Leipzig. Tuchel somewhat surprisingly relied on Leon Goretzka in midfield and Dayot Upamecano in the back four for the league opener.

 Min-Jae Kim also made his Bundesliga debut, while Kane was in the starting eleven for the first time in Munich. Star newcomer Kane was also directly involved in Munich&#39;s early lead, England&#39;s captain served the starting Sané with a perfect pass in his first successful offensive action, who left Werder keeper Jiri Pavlenka no chance to defend.

 The hopes of many neutral observers that the Munich team could also wobble at the start of the season after the Supercup defeat and heat up the tension in the title fight were put a first damper on. The goal played into the hands of the self-confident Munich team.

 Cleverly directed by Goretzka, the defending champions rarely let the ball slip out of their hands. With clean passing, FC Bayern repeatedly worked its way into the penalty area of the northern Germans, only lacking the final precision.

 In the 19th minute, international Jamal Musiala just missed a second goal. 120 seconds later, Nouassir Mazraoui also failed by just a few centimeters.

The Green-Whites&#39; back line had to work hard against Bayern&#39;s fast outfield players and was often too late. But there was also danger from the second row.

 However, Pavlenka was alert to Goretzka&#39;s long-range shot (34). But Bayern&#39;s immense pressure did not let up until the halftime break.

 After the change of ends, the hosts, unmistakably driven forward by coach Werner, became much bolder. Leonardo Bittencourt narrowly failed to score (47th), and the crowd sensed a surprise.

 Luck for SV Werder, however, that Kingsley Coman only hit the post in the 58th minute. 180 seconds later, Kane found his master in Pavlenka.

 But the Bremen team also had its opportunities, Jens Stage missed in a promising position (62nd). So the Munich team had to tremble a little - until Kane scored.

 The nimble Alphonso Davies had outrun his opponents and the captain of the English national team held his nerve in front of Pavlenka. In the 84th minute, Kane, who was on the move a lot and dropped deeper every now and then, had his day off.

 Sané then added to his tally, with substitute Thomas Müller laying on the ball. It was Sané&#39;s first brace in the Bundesliga.

 The final goal was scored by Joker Tel, who had come on shortly before for Kane. On Matchday 2, Bremen is challenged in Freiburg (Saturday, Aug.

 26, 2023, 3:30 p.m.). FC Bayern will play FC Augsburg on Sunday (Aug.

 27, 2023, 5:30 p.m.).
