Deadly wildfires have been raging in Hawaii, with the town of Lahaina on the island of Maui bearing the brunt of the destruction. The fire, which started under dry conditions and strong winds, quickly engulfed the town, leaving buildings on both sides of the street &#39;engulfed&#39; in flames. As a result, many people lost their jobs and homes, making the impact of the fire devastating for the community.

The exact cause of the fire is still unknown, but authorities suspect that the combination of dry conditions, low humidity, and high winds played a significant role. Additionally, Hurricane Dora, which was moving across the Pacific Ocean south of the Hawaiian islands, generated powerful winds that fueled the flames. The fire&#39;s rapid spread prompted an emergency proclamation from Hawaii&#39;s acting governor, Sylvia Luke, who authorized the deployment of National Guard troops to assist with the firefighting efforts.
