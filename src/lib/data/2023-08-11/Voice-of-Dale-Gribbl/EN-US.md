&#39;King of the Hill&#39; is an Emmy-winning animated series set in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas. The show follows the life of Hank Hill, his wife Peggy, and their teenage son Bobby. Hardwick&#39;s character, Dale Gribble, was a conspiracy theorist and neighbor to Hank Hill.

 Hardwick has been an incredibly beloved member of the &#39;King of the Hill&#39; family, and his talent, humor, and friendship will be deeply missed by all who were fortunate enough to work with him over the past 25 years. His voice gave life to one of the show&#39;s most iconic characters, and he will be truly missed.
