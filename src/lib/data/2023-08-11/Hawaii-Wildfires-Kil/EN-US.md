Hurricane-borne wildfires spread like wildfire. Some people jumped into the ocean to escape the fire and smoke A church and mission building are engulfed in flames in Lahaina, Hawaii, U.S. island of Maui, where a major wildfire broke out on Aug.

 8. Lahaina/AP At least 36 people have been killed and dozens more injured in a series of large wildfires on the U.S. island of Maui in the world-famous Hawaiian archipelago, officials said Monday night.

 Maui County, Hawaii, said in a news release on its social media accounts overnight that a total of 36 people are believed to have died in the wildfires in the Lahaina area. Earlier in the day, authorities said six people had died, but additional deaths were discovered during the firefighting process. The deaths came as the wildfire gained momentum, reducing much of the historic city of Lahaina on the northwestern coast of the island of Maui to ashes, the Associated Press reported earlier in the day.

 The fire had been ravaging homes and commercial buildings in Lahaina, population 12,000, since the previous night. Lahaina, the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii from 1820 to 1845 and a base for whaling fleets, is a tourist destination with buildings dating back to the 18th century lining its main street. &#39;Do not go to Lahaina,&#39; Maui County officials advised on Twitter.

 Flames rage in Lahaina, Maui, Hawaiian Islands, September 9, 2018. Reuters Yonhap More than 2,100 people, including tourists and residents, have been evacuated from this and other areas of Maui.

 More than 4,000 tourists were stranded at Kahului Airport on Maui. Hundreds of homes are estimated to have burned in the three large wildfires that raged through Lahaina and elsewhere. The Hawaii State Department of Transportation urged people to avoid traveling to Maui unless absolutely necessary.

The wildfires were fueled by high winds from Hurricane Dora as it approached Hawaii. Residents prepared for flooding as the hurricane approached, but what they got instead was a major fire. With winds reaching 130 kilometers per hour, firefighting helicopters couldn&#39;t get airborne.

 The night before, people jumped into the ocean, unable to escape the sudden onslaught of fire and smoke. The U.S. Coast Guard said it rescued 14 people off Lahaina. Passersby look on in horror at a wildfire on a street in Lahaina, the center of the Hawaiian island of Maui, where a massive wildfire broke out on Aug.

 8. AP Hawaii Lt. Gov.

 Sylvia Luke told CNN that people need to be transported off the island of Maui because of a lack of hospital facilities to treat burn victims, but that is not possible. President Joe Biden has &#39;directed the mobilization of all available federal assets,&#39; she said, adding that the Hawaii National Guard and the U.S. Navy&#39;s Third Fleet have been deployed to the rescue. The U.S. Department of Transportation said it was working with airlines to get tourists off the island of Maui.

 The exact cause of the fire is unclear. Hawaii state officials said hot, dry weather, high winds and dry vegetation may have played a role in starting or exacerbating the fires. The large wildfires are believed to be the result of fires that were thought to be out, but were reignited by high winds from the hurricane on Aug.

 1. Hawaii is known for its tropical downpours, but some say climate change has increased the risk of wildfires.
