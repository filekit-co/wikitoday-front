Education Ministry Investigates Employee Who Reported Child Abuse by Child&#39;s Teacher. Allegations have emerged that a fifth-level bureaucrat at the Ministry of Education reported his elementary school child&#39;s homeroom teacher for child abuse, leading to his suspension from his job. In a letter to the teacher, the bureaucrat reportedly demanded that the child &#39;speak nicely to him because he has the DNA of a king.

 Following the controversy, the Ministry of Education requested the Daejeon Office of Education, where the officer is currently employed, to suspend him and launch an investigation. The National Elementary School Teachers&#39; Labor Union (Chogyojo) said on Tuesday that it received a report that Ms. G, a parent of an elementary school student in Sejong City, had reported that Ms. N had been removed from her position in November last year after she continued to complain against her homeroom teacher and accused him of child abuse. The Sejong City Office of Education reportedly removed Ms. N from her position after receiving a report of child abuse.

The teacher was cleared by prosecutors in May of this year, Chogyojo said. On the same day, Chogyojo also released a letter from a parent, Ms. G, to the homeroom teacher. In the letter, she laid out a list of things to keep in mind when guiding her child.

 &#39;Never use restraining words such as &#39;Don&#39;t,&#39; &#39;No,&#39; or &#39;Stop,&#39;&#39; &#39;Thoroughly take sides in conflicts with peers,&#39; and &#39;Use a tone of invitation and request rather than instruction and command. Because he has the DNA of a king, he can understand everything you say, even if you turn it around to make it sound like you&#39;re talking to a prince,&#39; and &#39;Don&#39;t force him to bow his head in greeting. Chogyojo said Mr. G was a fifth-level education ministry official at the time of the child abuse report and was transferred to a new position as administrative director of a school in Daejeon in a March reshuffle.

 Later that night, the ministry sought to clarify Chogyozo&#39;s allegations. &#39;We have organized an investigation team and immediately launched an investigation,&#39; the ministry said in an explanatory statement, adding, &#39;We have notified the Daejeon Office of Education, where the subject of the investigation works, of the start of the investigation, requested his removal from office, and will take strict action against those involved based on the results of the investigation.&#39; Kang Deuk-gu, a Democratic Party of Korea lawmaker who is a member of the National Assembly&#39;s education committee, will hold a press conference on the 11th to call for a ministry-wide response to the infringement of educational activities by parents who are former education ministry officials.
