<div class="article-body">
The consumer price index rose 3.2% from a year ago in July, a sign that inflation has lost at least some of its grip on the U.S. economy. Prices accelerated a seasonally adjusted 0.2% for the month, in line with the Dow Jones estimate, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday. However, the annual rate was slightly below the 3.3% forecast though higher than June and the first increase in more than a year.

 Excluding volatile food and energy prices so-called core CPI also increased 0.2% for the month, matching the estimate and equating to a 12-month rate of 4.7%, the lowest since October 2021. The annual rate for the core also was slightly below a Dow Jones consensus estimate for 4.8%. Markets reacted positively to the report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average up more than 200 points and Treasury yields mostly lower.

&#39;It is not quite &#39;mission accomplished&#39; yet, but significant progress on the inflation front has been made,&#39; said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at SS Economics and professor of economics and finance at Loyola Marymount University. &#39;On balance, the inflation picture has improved significantly. The Federal Reserve will stop raising the interest rate soon.&#39; Almost all of the monthly inflation increase came from shelter costs, which rose 0.4% and were up 7.7% from a year ago.

 Rents rose 0.4% The BLS said more than 90% of the increase came from that category, which accounts for about one-third of the CPI weighting. Food prices climbed 0.2% on the month, and the BLS said energy increased just 0.1% even though crude oil prices surged during the month and prices at the pump jumped as well. Used vehicle prices declined 1.3% and medical care services were off 0.4%.

 Airline fares fell 8.1% on the month, the same as in June, and are down 18.6% from a year ago after surging in the early days of the Covid pandemic. &#39;While it would be fair to describe prices as still relatively high in places such as shelter and used cars, we are witnessing a rate of change that is encouraging to consumers, as well as to Federal Reserve policymakers,&#39; said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at asset management giant BlackRock.
