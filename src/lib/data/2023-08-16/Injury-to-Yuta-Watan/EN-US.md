The Japanese men&#39;s national basketball team (ranked 36th in the world) faced off against the Angola national team (ranked 41st) in an international friendly match on the 15th as part of the SoftBank CUP 2023 (Tokyo tournament). In the first half, Japan trailed behind with a 32-36 scoreline, unable to catch up.

 NBA player Yuta Watanabe, the ace of the Japanese team, started the game and made a significant impact from the first quarter. Watanabe grabbed his own rebound and made a layup, steadily scoring points.

 However, once Watanabe was substituted, the situation changed. Angola&#39;s tall players dominated the inside game, grabbing rebounds and scoring points.

 The first quarter ended with a score of 14-16 in favor of Angola. In the second quarter, Angola initially took control and Japan had to play catch-up.

However, Keio Tomioka, a Japanese player, made consecutive three-pointers, narrowing the gap to 22-23 with 5 minutes and 56 seconds remaining. But Japan once again fell behind.

 With 3 minutes and 27 seconds left, Watanabe encountered an incident when he collided with an Angolan player in the opponent&#39;s zone. Watanabe fell to the ground and struggled to get up.

 Although he managed to stand, he had to make his way to the locker room, favoring his right foot. In Watanabe&#39;s absence, Japan rallied and started making three-pointers.

 Yuuki Takeuchi, Shohei Inoue, and Yutaka Yoshii all scored three-pointers, bringing the score to 32-36 at halftime. Tomioka, who made 3 three-pointers, had the highest score on the team with 11 points, while Watanabe contributed 4 points and 6 rebounds on both ends of the court.

 The upcoming schedule for the Japanese men&#39;s national basketball team includes a friendly match against the French national team (ranked 5th in the world) on August 17th and a match against the Slovenian national team (ranked 7th) on August 19th.
