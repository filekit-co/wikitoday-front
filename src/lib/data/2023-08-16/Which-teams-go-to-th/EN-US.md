<div class="article-body">
The finalists of the Copa do Brasil will be known this Wednesday (16). Corinthians and São Paulo, and Flamengo and Grêmio will face each other again for the return game of the semifinals of the competition.

 Timão, who won the first match 2-1, play for a draw in Morumbi to reach the decision. Rubro-negro, on the other hand, can lose by up to a goal difference at Maracanã, which will still reach the final.

 Because of this, we asked the journalists of Lance! which teams go to the final of the Copa do Brasil? Check them out below.

 Vinicius Perazzini, editor: São Paulo and Flamengo.

 I believe in pressure from São Paulo until they get the score they need. As for Rio, despite Flamengo&#39;s bad moment, the advantage built in the South is very solid.

 Jalile Elias, reporter: Corinthians and Flamengo.

 Luxemburgo&#39;s side are on a positive run and I believe they can advance to the final of the Copa do Brasil by holding off Sao Paulo at the Morumbi, but a derby is a derby. The clash is open and anything can happen.

 In the other clash, I believe Flamengo will reach the final, as they got a good advantage away from home and will now play in front of their fans at Maracanã and can lose by up to one goal. However, if internal problems come into play...

 Andreza Ferraz, editor: Sao Paulo and Gremio.

Because of the reinforcements and confidence of the moment, I believe that São Paulo qualifies for the final. And Gremio, as they have nothing to lose, will at least try to take the game to penalties, taking advantage of Flamengo&#39;s &#39;turbulent&#39; atmosphere.

 Alexandre Guariglia, reporter: Corinthians and Flamengo.

 It&#39;s obvious that the two built a considerable advantage in the first leg of the clash. However, analyzing other factors, Corinthians comes in a much better moment than São Paulo, while Flamengo, despite not being in good shape, will have the Maracana on its side and with two goals ahead of Gremio.

 Rafael Oliva, reporter: Corinthians and Gremio.

 The Timon&#39;s came out on top and have a chance of holding off Sao Paulo&#39;s momentum at the Morumbi if they play smart and defend well. Meanwhile, Fla are &#39;boiling&#39; internally, and Gremio have a chance to seize the moment and reverse the adverse score.

 Rafaela Cardoso, reporter: Corinthians and Flamengo.

 For having won the first game and having a recent record in their favor against the arch-rival, I think Timão passes even though the game is in Morumbi. And Flamengo, for the good result of the first leg, comes out qualified from Maracanã.

 Rafael Marson, reporter: Corinthians and Flamengo.

 Even with all the turmoil in Gávea, I believe Flamengo can qualify for the final. Gremio wins at Maracana, but will not get the score needed to advance.

 In the Majestoso, I believe that the protagonists of both teams will appear. Lucas will take the decision to penalties, and Cássio will ensure Corinthians&#39; qualification against São Paulo in penalties.
