In early 2022, the family of US actor Bruce Willis announced that the action star (&#39;Die Hard&#39;) was suffering from aphasia and dementia. Since then, Willis withdrew from the film business and public life.

 His second wife Emma Heming-Willis now takes care of Bruce. That this is not easy, the 45-year-old now describes on her Instagram profile.

 Editor&#39;s recommendation Bruce Willis: Daughter tells harrowing details about the beginning of his dementia Emma about life with Bruce Willis&#39; disease: &#39;It&#39;s not always easy for me&#39;.

 In a short video, the former model, who has two daughters with Bruce Willis, shared what life with the former movie star is like today. She spoke candidly about how the situation is sometimes difficult for her to cope with as well, despite being perceived as a strong woman by Buce&#39;s side.

 &#39;I know it looks like I&#39;m living my best life. But I have to make a conscious effort every day to live the best life I can.

 I&#39;m doing this for myself. I&#39;m doing this for our two kids and Bruce, who doesn&#39;t want me to live any other way,&#39; she shared with her followers.

Furthermore, she confessed that despite the many challenges, she still can&#39;t forget herself: &#39;So I don&#39;t want it to be misconstrued that I&#39;m good. Because I&#39;m not,&#39; Emma Heming-Willis revealed in the video, &#39;but I have to take care of myself and my family, because if we don&#39;t take care of ourselves, we can&#39;t take care of the ones we love.

 [...] It&#39;s not easy for me. But I just always do my best.&#39;

 Bruce Willis has been diagnosed with aphasia. The neurological disease affects the speech center of the brain, causing loss of speech over a period of time.

 A little later, he was also diagnosed with dementia. The first rumors about Willis&#39; state of health arose when the actor mainly took small roles in cheap flicks.

 As it turned out later, these jobs were still the easiest to master for the sometimes probably confused Willis on the set. Since both diseases are degenerative, i.e. they become more serious with advancing age, recovery of Bruce Willis is impossible.

 However, director Quentin Tarantino, who cast Willis in 1996&#39;s &#39;Pulp Fiction,&#39; would like to give the actor a very last role.
