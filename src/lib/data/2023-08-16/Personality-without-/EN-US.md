"..." At the same time, these are songs for all times, companies still gather and sing Tsoi&#39;s songs just the same way. This is a story about a cult personality without a statute of limitations,&#39; he said.

 The music critic noted that at the same time Tsoi has hits that are popular now, but will be forgotten the next day. Among them, he mentioned &#39;Cuckoo,&#39; which became popular again thanks to other performers.

 Through covers, different versions of the performance, Babichev believes, people have a desire to listen to the original version and learn more about the group &#39;Kino&#39;, in which Tsoi performed. Earlier, the Bank of Russia issued a silver coin with a face value of three rubles under the name &#39;The Creativity of Victor Tsoi&#39;.

 The obverse of the coin depicts the musician himself, the founder and leader of the band &#39;Kino&#39;, with a microphone and a guitar in the background.
