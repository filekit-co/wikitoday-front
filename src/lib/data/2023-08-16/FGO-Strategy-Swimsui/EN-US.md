A look at the 5-star Ruler &#39;Mélusine&#39; from the smartphone game &#39;Fate/Grand Order&#39; (FGO), including her performance, skill effects, second coming and other training materials, and status. How to obtain

 Gacha: Servant Summer Festival 2023! Melusine (Ruler) Pickup Summon Melusine (Ruler) Pickup Summon Period : August 15, 2023 (Tue.) 18:00- (JST)

 Type : Limited time only : Tuesday, August 15, 2023 18:00~ Type : Limited time only Treasure Effect

 Treasure ：Sprite Albion, the heartbeat of innocence that bridges the rainbow Treasure Tool : Sprite Albion : The Heartbeat of Innocence that Bridges the Rainbow Card : Arts

 : Arts Rank : B Type ：B Type ：Traitorial

 Effect : Anti-Military Treasure Effect : Increases own attack power (3T) (effect increases with OC) &amp; increases critical power (3T) + powerful special attack on all enemies [enemies with earthly powers] [Lv. A powerful attack against all enemies with earthly powers:

 A multi-stage, all-around Arts attack treasure. With support from Altria Caster or Lady Avalon, she can easily fire three consecutive treasure attacks.

 80% NP charge skill allows her to fire treasure attacks even at 0% NP, which is her strength. In addition to the &#39;Power of the Earth&#39; special attack, the ability to increase attack power and critical power before a treasure tool is also extremely powerful.

 The attack and critical power increases last for 3 turns, so she reaches her maximum firepower in the final wave of her normal rounds. Combined with her own star generation ability and concentration increase by her skill, her attack power when her critical power is increased to the limit is quite impressive.

 She is an attacker who will be very useful not only in circuits but also in high difficulty quests. Mélusine: Bridging the rainbow, the innocent heartbeat

 Skills Skill 1

 Name : Fairy Pack A Fairy Pack A CT : 8-6

 Effect: Increases the performance of your Arts cards [Lv.] (3T) &amp; increases critical power [Lv.] (3T) &amp; grants [Chaos] special attack status [Lv.] (3T) + grants damage reduction status to all allies except yourself [Lv.] (3T) Skill 2

 Skill 2 Name : Azure Sky Training A

 CT : 7-5 Effect: Increases your Star Concentration [Lv.] (3T) &amp; grants a Star Gaining state every turn [Lv.] (3T) Lv.1: 5 pieces Lv.10: 10 pieces &amp; grants a Star Gaining state every turn only in the [Water] or [Air] field [Lv.] (3T) Lv.1: 10 pieces Lv.10 20 + 10 fixed stars + 20 fixed stars only in the field of [Water] or [Aerial].

 Fixed 20 stars: Skill 3

 Name : Blue Horizon EX CT : Blue Horizon EX CT : 8-6

 Effect: Increases your NP by 50% (Lv. 1), 80% (Lv. 10), and increases the power of your treasure tool (Lv. 1) (3T) &amp; grants invincibility (2 times, 3T). NP charge is 80%:

 Maximum NP charge is 80%. If the magic charge level is 10, the treasure can be activated immediately without the help of other Servants.

 Powerful Arts supporters such as Altria Caster and Lady Avalon have skills that can supply 20% NP, so an 80% NP charge is just right. In some cases, using powerful NP supplying roles with Order Change included &amp; at full capacity will result in an oversupply of NP.

 This means that in some cases, even in quests with a small number of appearing enemies, it is possible to fire 3 consecutive shots of treasure, making it an extremely versatile attacker for circumnavigating. Class Skills

 Anti-Magic B: Increases the knight&#39;s resistance to weak attacks Riding A+: Improves his Quick Card performance.

 Fairy Knight C: Increases her critical power against enemies with human powers. Reincarnation Materials
