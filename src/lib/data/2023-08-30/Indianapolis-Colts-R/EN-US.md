The Colts did not find what it felt was a fair-value offer for Jonathan Taylor and decided against trading him, sources told ESPN. As a result, Taylor will continue to be on the physically unable to perform list, making him ineligible to play in the first four games of the season.

 The Colts may have another chance to trade Taylor before the NFL&#39;s October 31 trade deadline. If no deal is reached by then, the Colts could use the franchise tag on Taylor and attempt to trade him next offseason.

Last week, the Colts gave Taylor and his representatives permission to explore trade options with other teams. However, no suitable deal was found.

 Taylor&#39;s contract situation with the Colts has been contentious, with the team choosing not to offer him a contract extension in May. Taylor led the NFL in rushing yards in 2021 but has been dealing with ankle injuries.

 The Colts&#39; running back unit will consist of Zack Moss, Deon Jackson, and Evan Hull in Taylor&#39;s absence.
