Uchidate, who is 56 years old and a native of Morioka City, is the president of a building materials company and the president of the Morioka Junior Chamber of Commerce. Throughout his campaign, he emphasized the need for a minibus service connecting the city center and suburbs and the establishment of a scholarship system for high school and university students. Uchidate&#39;s victory was supported not only by independent voters but also by some supporters of the incumbent party.

 In his victory speech, Uchidate expressed his commitment to listening to the voices of citizens and making decisions with a sense of speed. The incumbent, Hiroaki Tanifuji, expressed his gratitude to the citizens of Morioka and hoped for the city&#39;s continued prosperity under the next administration.
