On certain days, dry fasting is observed, allowing only uncooked vegetable food such as bread, fruits, vegetables, dried fruits, nuts, and honey. On other days, hot food without oil is permitted, including porridge, soups, boiled vegetables, and mushrooms.

 The consumption of fish and seafood is allowed only on the Feast of the Transfiguration of the Lord. Apart from dietary restrictions, believers are encouraged to spend more time attending religious services and engaging in prayers.
