=Munchen [Footer=Kim Dong-min] The Bundesliga secretariat believes that Kim Dong-min will be the starter for Bayern Munich.

 The same goes for Harry Kane. The Bundesliga released its projected best 11 for Munich this season on its official website on Wednesday. The formation is 4-2-3-1, with Kane up front and Kingsley Coman, Jamal Moussaoui, and Serge Gnabry in the second line.

 The midfield consisted of Joshua Kimmich and Konrad Reimer. The defense consisted of Alfonso Davies, Kim Min-Jae, Mathias Der Licht, and Vincent Pavard, with Sven Ulreich in goal. Munich had a disappointing season last season.

 The Bavarians have long been a dominant force in the Bundesliga. Last season, many predicted that they would win the title again. However, things didn&#39;t turn out as expected.

 Dortmund took over the top spot, and the Bavarians played catch-up. It was a back-and-forth league. After losing to Dortmund, Munich made a decision.

 They fired Julian Nagelsmann and hired Thomas Tuchel. Upon his arrival, Tuchel declared that a treble was the goal. However, they were eliminated in the quarterfinals of both the UEFA Champions League (UCL) and DFB Pokal.

 Fortunately, Dortmund lost to Mainz in the final to win the league title. To bounce back from last season&#39;s disappointment, Munich has been on a recruiting spree. The Bavarians had a big hole to fill with Robert Lewandowski.

 When Lewandowski left for Barcelona, Eric Choupo-Moting replaced him, but it wasn&#39;t enough to fill the void. Choupo-Moting only scored 10 goals. The signing of Sadio Mane from Liverpool also proved unsuccessful.

 Defensively, the team was also shaky. Dayo Upamecano faltered, leaving a crack at the back, most notably in the UCL quarterfinal against Manchester City, where Upamecano&#39;s fatal error cost them the lead. After the UCL exit, Upamecano was widely criticized.

 To fill in the gaps, Munich selected Kane in attack and Kim Min-jae in defense. In just one season, Kim transformed into a world-class defender. Kim came to Napoli from Fenerbahçe in Turkey.

He was chosen to replace Kalidou Koulibaly when he left Napoli. There were doubters. Despite his dominant performances at Turkiye, he was clearly not up to the standard of the European big leagues.

 However, those worries were for naught. He proved his worth as soon as he joined Napoli. He was at the peak of his powers throughout the season, leading Napoli&#39;s breakthrough.

 Napoli won the Scudetto for the first time in 33 years and reached the UCL quarterfinals for the first time in the club&#39;s history. Kim was at the heart of Napoli&#39;s success. He was named Serie A Defender of the Year for his performance.

 Big clubs were interested in Kim&#39;s performance. Manchester United, Man City, and Munich were among the clubs tracking him. In the early stages of the transfer market, it looked like United were close.

 While United held back, Munich stepped up to the plate. The transfer went smoothly, and Kim Min-jae wore a Munich jersey. [Munich](https://example.com/image1.jpg)

 [Munich](https://example.com/image2.jpg) The Bavarians didn&#39;t give up and eventually landed Kane. The Bavarians announced the signing of Kane on Wednesday via the club&#39;s official website, stating, &#39;Munich has acquired Kane from Tottenham.

 Kane has signed a contract with Munich until June 2027,&#39; the club announced on its official website. Kane will wear the number nine shirt. After signing Kane a day before kickoff, Munich moved quickly to register him.

 He quickly completed his medical and registered. This was to ensure that Kane would be available for the German Super Cup. Munich lost 0-3 to RB Leipzig in the 2023-24 German Super Cup at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany, at 3:45 a.m. ET on Sept.

 13. Kim Min-jae came on at the start of the second half and Kane took the field in the 18th minute. It was an eventful game, but a 0-3 defeat doesn&#39;t feel good.

 Locals in Germany are predicting Kane&#39;s place in the starting lineup. Kim is not 100% fit as he is undergoing basic military training. After a poor start, Munich will open the league against Werder Bremen at 3:30 a.m. on Sept.

 19. The key will be whether Kim is fit or not.
