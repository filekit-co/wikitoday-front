Liverpool have reached an agreement with Southampton for the transfer of Romeo Lavia, according to sources. The deal, reported to be worth £60m, was finalized on Sunday night. However, Chelsea is still actively pursuing the 19-year-old midfielder and was on the verge of a deal with Southampton just last week.

 Liverpool&#39;s pursuit of Lavia comes after missing out on the signing of Moises Caicedo, who opted to join Chelsea instead. The Blues secured the services of Caicedo with a record-breaking £115m deal with Brighton. Southampton had originally valued Lavia at £50m, but Chelsea had submitted a £48m offer last week, while Liverpool had previously seen three bids rejected earlier in the summer transfer window.

Despite the setback, Chelsea is determined to bring in two midfielders and had engaged in talks with Leeds United for Tyler Adams, but negotiations fell apart. Lavia, who joined Southampton from Manchester City last year, still has four years remaining on his contract but is expected to depart following the club&#39;s relegation from the Premier League last season. Notably, Lavia did not feature in Southampton&#39;s recent matches, fueling speculation about his future.

 Both Liverpool and Chelsea are eager to bolster their squads in the ongoing transfer window, with Liverpool hoping to convince Lavia to make the move to Anfield.
