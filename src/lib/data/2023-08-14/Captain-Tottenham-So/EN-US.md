2-2 draw with Brentford on Thursday. Tottenham Hotspur&#39;s Son Heung-min reacts after missing a scoring chance during their 2023-2024 English Premier League (EPL) first-leg match against visiting Brentford at the Wembley Community Stadium in London, England, on Thursday, Sept. 13, 2018.

 London/AFP &#39;Captain Sonny&#39;s&#39; first game was unlucky. Tottenham Hotspur&#39;s first win of the season has come and gone.

 Spurs drew 2-2 with visiting Brentford in their opening match of the 2023-2024 English Premier League (EPL) season at the GTEK Community Stadium in London, England, on Wednesday (Aug. 13). In his debut in charge of Tottenham, manager Ange Postecoglou was denied his first Premier League win.

 Postecoglou&#39;s attacking tactics from preseason have yet to be fully integrated. After the departure of Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), Postecoglou went with an attacking lineup that included new signings James Maddison, Son Heung-min, and Dejan Klucepski up front. Summer signings Micky Van der Vaart and goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario were also named in the starting lineup for their Premier League debuts.

 After an ambitious start, Spurs opened the scoring in the 11th minute when Christian Romero headed home a free kick from Maddison. Tottenham manager Enzi Postecoglou greets fans after the match against Brentford. London/Reuters

The lead didn&#39;t last long. In the 23rd minute, Son Heung-min fouled opposing midfielder Matthias Jensen in defense just inside the penalty box, and a penalty was awarded after video assistant referee (VAR) review. Brentford striker Brian Mbembo stepped up to take the spot-kick and lightly leveled the scores in the 36th minute when Rico Henry&#39;s cut-back pass after a dynamic run was met with a left-footed strike by Yoann Wissa.

 Tottenham struck again in the 48th minute of first-half stoppage time when Maddison&#39;s cross from outside the box was met by Emerson Royal with a right-footed volley into the top corner. Tottenham also traveled to Brentford last season, drawing 2-2 and losing 1-3 at home. Spurs finished eighth in the league last season, with Brentford ninth, just one point above them.

 New signing James Maddison with two assists on his Tottenham debut. London/Reuters It was a disappointing opening, especially for Son Heung-min, who was made a pre-match official.

 He conceded a penalty just when he needed to spark things up after scoring the opening goal, and was limited to just one shot on target before being substituted in the second half. According to soccer stats site FutbolScore.com, Heung-min earned a rating of . It was the second lowest among Tottenham players who played on the day.
