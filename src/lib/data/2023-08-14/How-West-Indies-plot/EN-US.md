India&#39;s impressive comeback in the five-match series, especially after trailing 0-2, was truly remarkable. Their outstanding performances in the third and fourth T20Is had seemingly set them on a course to easily clinch the series with a 3-2 victory , but things didn&#39;t go the way India wanted.Riding on Suryakumar Yadav &#39;s resilient innings of 61 runs from 45 balls, India set a challenging target of 165 for 9 in their allotted 20 overs.In response, West Indies, who failed to qualify for this year&#39;s ODI World Cup, put up a dominant display with the bat, leaving India&#39;s bowlers struggling, and managed to chase down the total in just 18 overs and win the series 3-2 at the Central Broward Regional Park Stadium Turf Ground at Lauderhill in Florida.Reflecting on the T20I series victory against India, West Indies all-rounder Romario Shepherd shared that their strategy to dismiss Sanju Samson and Suryakumar Yadav.&#39;To Sanju, the plan was to hit the wicket and to Surya to get him to hit straight down the ground. [On the series win] It meant a lot to us especially because we&#39;ve been going through some hard times in the past couple of months so to win against a team like India it means a lot for us and the fans,&#39; said Shepherd in the post-match presentation.Suryakumar scored a brillaint fifty, including four boundaries and a six but Sanju Samson (13) and skipper Hardik Pandya (14) failed to provide much support from the other end.
