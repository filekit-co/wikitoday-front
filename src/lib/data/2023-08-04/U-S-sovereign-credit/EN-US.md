        <summary><b>0. What is the impact of Fitch's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating?</b></summary>
        Fitch's downgrade reflects the expected fiscal deterioration in the United States over the next three years, as well as a growing sovereign debt burden and deteriorating governance. It is the first time in 12 years since 2011 that the three major international credit rating agencies have downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating.

        <summary><b>1. Will the U.S. sovereign credit rating downgrade have a similar impact to the 2011 downgrade?</b></summary>
        There is a strong case to be made that the impact of Fitch's downgrade of the U.S. will be limited, given the proximity of the 2011 default to the federal debt limit, the proximity of the 2008 global financial crisis, and the fact that Fitch had already warned of a downgrade in May when it placed the U.S. sovereign rating outlook on 'negative watch.' Additionally, the U.S. economy is currently on a soft landing.

        <summary><b>2. How did the market react to the U.S. sovereign credit rating downgrade?</b></summary>
        The market reaction to the downgrade was relatively subdued. Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were down less than 0.5%, while the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note slightly decreased. However, Asian stocks and currencies were hit hard, as investors pulled out of risky Asian markets due to a growing preference for safe assets.

        <summary><b>3. What is the main focus in the aftermath of the U.S. sovereign credit rating downgrade?</b></summary>
        The main focus is on the exchange rate, as the stronger dollar is making a comeback after a recent lull. A stronger dollar can help export domestic inflation abroad, and greater demand for U.S. Treasuries will lead to lower Treasury yields, reducing the government's interest burden.

## U.S. sovereign credit rating downgraded for first time in 12 years...Asian stocks slammed

_2023-08-04 - wikitoday_

Ratings agency Fitch headquarters in New York, U.S. [EPA Yonhap photo] The sovereign credit rating of the United States has been downgraded. It was the first time in 12 years since 2011, and the world's financial markets are nervous. As Korea cannot be safe from the turbulence in the U.S. financial market, it will be interesting to see how the U.S. sovereign credit rating downgrade will affect the financial market. Fitch downgrades US sovereign rating after 12 years International credit rating agency Fitch downgraded the sovereign credit rating of the United States from 'AAA' to 'AA+' on January 1 (local time). This is the first time in 12 years since 2011 that the three major international credit rating agencies have downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit rating, and the implications for financial markets and the real economy will be closely watched. Fitch today downgraded the U.S. long-term foreign currency issuer rating (IDRs) by one notch to AA+ from AAA and revised the outlook to 'stable' from 'negative watch'. 'The downgrade reflects the expected fiscal deterioration in the United States over the next three years, as well as a growing sovereign debt burden and deteriorating governance,' Fitch said in a report. In particular, Fitch noted that governance has deteriorated compared to other countries with AA or AAA ratings, as U.S. politicians have repeatedly stalled over raising the debt limit, only to resolve the issue at the last minute. Trends in U.S. sovereign credit ratings 'The U.S. has seen a steady deterioration in governance standards for more than two decades,' Fitch said, noting that 'fiscal and debt problems remain despite a bipartisan agreement in June to suspend the debt limit until January 2025. Meanwhile, Fitch expects the U.S. deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) to surge from 3.7% in 2022 to 6.3% in 2023, followed by 6.6% in 2024 and 6.9% in 2025, as a result of lower tax revenues, higher deficit spending, and a growing interest burden. Fitch also warned about the economic future of the U.S., saying that 'over the next decade, rising interest rates and rising debt will increase interest payments, while an aging population and rising healthcare costs will increase spending on the elderly in the absence of fiscal reform,' and even predicted a recession in the U.S. sooner rather than later, saying that 'deteriorating credit conditions, lower investment, and falling consumption will push the U.S. economy into a mild recession in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year. Fitch cut the U.S. sovereign rating by one notch to AA+ from AAA, while Moody's maintained its Aaa rating and Standard & Poor's affirmed its AA+ rating. Will there be a repeat of the 2011 sovereign downgrade shock? It's been 12 years since the last time a major international credit rating agency downgraded the U.S. sovereign rating, when Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered it from AAA to AA+ in 2011. At the time, S&P cited political impasse over raising the U.S. debt ceiling as the reason for the downgrade. The move sent shockwaves through international financial markets, with the dollar depreciating and stock prices plummeting. The large-cap S&P500 index dropped 15% in just a few days, and panic spread across European and Asian stock markets. However, the price of US Treasury bonds, which are considered a safe haven asset, rose due to the combination of risk aversion and safe-haven sentiment. The question is whether Fitch's downgrade of the U.S. will follow in the footsteps of Standard & Poor's downgrade of the U.S. in 2011. There is a strong case to be made that the impact of Fitch's downgrade of the U.S. will be limited, given the proximity of the 2011 default to the federal debt limit, the proximity of the 2008 global financial crisis, the fact that Fitch had already warned of a downgrade in May when it placed the U.S. sovereign rating outlook on 'negative watch,' and the fact that, unlike in 2011, the U.S. economy is on a soft landing. On the other hand, with U.S. equity markets near historic highs, Fitch's downgrade could trigger a correction, and any further downgrades could be devastating to the federal government's fiscal health.

Is a Stronger Dollar and Lower Treasury Yields Best for the U.S.? According to Bloomberg, the market reaction to the downgrade was relatively subdued. Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were each down less than 0.5%, while the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was at 4.03% as of 4:40 p.m. ET, down one basis point (bp=0.01 percentage point) from the previous day. A decline in bond yields implies a rise in bond prices. Meanwhile, U.S. equity futures showed a sharp correction as the market opened. The U.S. sovereign credit rating downgrade continues to strengthen the dollar. In this photo, employees organize dollar bills at the head office of Hana Bank in Euljiro, Jung-gu, Seoul. Oct. 6, 2022 Fitch's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating is hitting Asian stocks and currencies hard. Asian stocks and currencies weakened in unison on Oct. 2. This is because the growing preference for safe assets such as the U.S. dollar and government bonds is causing investors to pull out of Asian markets categorized as risky. According to the Korea Exchange, the Kospi fell 50.60 points, or 1.9%, to close at 2616.47, a day after hitting a yearly high of 2667.07 the day before, while the KOSPI fell 29.91 points, or 3.18%, to 909.76. Japan's Nikkei 225 ended the day down 2.30% at 32,707.69, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng (-2.47%), China's Shanghai Composite (-0.89%) and Taiwan's KMT (-1.85%) were also down. European markets, which open after the Asian close, are also in the red, with the pan-European index, the Euro Stoxx 50, down more than 1%. The main focus is on the exchange rate. This is because the stronger dollar is making a comeback after a recent lull. At the Seoul foreign exchange market, the won/dollar exchange rate soared to 1,298.5 won, up 14.7 won from the previous trading day. It was the biggest one-day surge since March 24, when it rose 16.0 won amid financial turmoil in the U.S. banking sector, and the first time in about three weeks that it has touched the 1,300-won level since March 10 (1306.5 won). The dollar index, which measures the greenback's value against a basket of six major currencies, stood at 102.21 as of 3:30 p.m. KST. A dollar index above the 100 mark indicates that the greenback is stronger against a basket of major currencies. It's unclear how much of a ripple Fitch's downgrade of the U.S. will cause or where it will go. What is clear is that global money's preference for the dollar and U.S. Treasuries is a blessing in disguise for the United States. A strong dollar is a way to export domestic inflation abroad, and greater demand for Treasuries will lead to lower Treasury yields, reducing the government's interest burden.
