## Saemangeum Jamboree Faces Serious Issues Due to Lack of Preparation

_2023-08-04 - wikitoday_

The World Jamboree 2023 event being held in the Saemangeum area of Buanan-gun, Jeollabuk-do, has been plagued by a serious lack of preparation. At the opening ceremony alone, 108 people were found to be suffering from fever, and the number of sick people has since exceeded 1,000. Minister Lee Sang-min, who returned to work following his impeachment, is facing criticism for the lack of safety measures at the event. The Saemangeum campsite, chosen for the Jamboree, lacked structures that could provide natural shade, making it especially vulnerable during the hot summer. In addition, the site's poor drainage system combined with heavy rain and a heat wave created unpleasant conditions for the participants. These challenges have resulted in a shortage of medical supplies, including medication to treat fever and dehydration. Paramedics were also hastily deployed due to the lack of on-site medical personnel. The unsatisfactory conditions were further exacerbated by reports of insufficient shower facilities, unhygienic toilets, and overpriced items at the event.

The situation at the Jamboree has attracted international attention. The UK's Guardian reported on the heatwave-related issues, and European countries have expressed their concerns to the South Korean government. Participants and their families have taken to social media to express their dissatisfaction with the event's organization. In response to the crisis, Minister of Health and Welfare Cho Kyu-hong visited the Jamboree Hospital to review the medical response and address the difficulties faced by the medical staff. Prime Minister Han Deok-soo has also ordered additional measures to ensure the safety of the participants, including the deployment of military personnel. The government's lack of preparedness despite years of planning and increased budget allocation has raised questions about its ability to handle large-scale events. Despite the challenges, efforts are being made to improve the situation and provide necessary support to the participants. The organizers have allowed limited press access to address transparency concerns. With the goal of a successful Jamboree, it is crucial for the government and organizers to address the current issues and prioritize the well-being of the participants.
