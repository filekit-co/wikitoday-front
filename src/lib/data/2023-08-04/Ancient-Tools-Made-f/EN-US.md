Even before the Iron Age, tools could be made from iron. Smelting technology was immature, but iron could be obtained from meteorites. Rocks from space contain metals like nickel and silicates, and scientists are studying ancient tools made from extraterrestrial materials. The art of working with iron began to emerge during the Late Bronze Age. It is believed to have originated in ancient Anatolia between 1200 and 1000 B.C. However, an iron arrowhead held by the Museum of History in Bern, Switzerland, is older than the Iron Age. Scholars believe it is a weapon made from a meteorite. According to the Bern History Museum, there are only 55 archaeological artifacts in the world that are made from meteorites. A recent paper published in the Journal of Archaeological Sciences detailed the arrowhead. The object is 1.5 inches long and weighs 2.9 grams and was excavated in the 19th century. It came from Mörigen, a lake settlement where people were active during the Late Bronze Age. It is five miles from the location where the Meteorite of Twanberg struck the Earth 150,000 years ago. The meteorite was once speculated to be the source of the arrowheads, but research has shown that the mineral could not have been used by ancient people.

We have yet to detect any Twanberg meteorite components in arrowheads or other artifacts. The arrowhead contains 8.3% nickel, twice as much as the meteorite. According to the researchers, the arrowhead has a low aluminum-26 concentration and a high percentage of geranium. These values raise the possibility that the parent material is an IAB type meteorite. An IAB-type meteorite is one that is composed of metal. It is estimated to have a mass of at least two tons. So far, only three meteorites have fallen in Europe with these characteristics. The authors of the paper claim that the Kaaliyarv meteorite provided the material for the arrowhead. This meteorite created a huge crater on the Estonian island of Saaremaa around 1500 BC. The impact point created a hole through modern-day Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia. As a result, countless pieces of iron meteorite were scattered. The scholars conclude that a trade and transportation system for iron may have existed at the time. They look forward to finding other ancient tools made from space rocks in the future.
