Max Boltman, a former Liverpool youth player, has penned a farewell message to the club's devoted fans. Boltman has been with Liverpool for 13 years, having joined the club as a young seven-year-old. Over the years, he worked his way up through the various age groups and showcased his talent in the U-18 Premier League. In the 2020-21 season, Boltman made a significant impact, scoring an impressive 10 goals and providing six assists in 23 games. This outstanding performance earned him a chance to make his senior debut in both the UEFA Champions League and the English FA Cup during the 2021-22 campaign. However, his opportunities with the first team were limited, and he spent most of the season playing in the Premier League 2, where he continued to excel with six goals and two assists in 23 appearances. Despite his dedication to Liverpool, Boltman's dream of making his English Premier League debut for the club did not materialize. In the summer of 2022, he decided to leave Liverpool and joined Oxford United on a free transfer.



Expressing his thoughts on the move, Boltman stated that everything happened quickly, but he was excited about joining Oxford due to their talented squad and great manager. He praised Oxford's playing style and tactics, emphasizing that the club deserves to be at a higher level and expressing his determination to help them achieve promotion. In his farewell message to Liverpool fans, Boltman expressed his gratitude for having the opportunity to wear the Liverpool shirt and fulfill his dreams as a fan. He fondly recalled his debut at Anfield, describing it as a moment he will never forget. Closing the chapter on his time at Liverpool, Boltman thanked the players, staff, and fans for making his Liverpool career memorable and expressed his honor at wearing the club badge. As he embarks on a new chapter with Oxford United, Boltman is eager to make his mark and contribute to the club's success. He believes that joining Oxford is a step forward and not a step backward, emphasizing his commitment to scoring goals and helping the team achieve promotion. With his talent, determination, and experience from playing in Liverpool's youth system, Boltman aims to bring a new level of excellence to Oxford United and fulfill his ambitions in professional football.
