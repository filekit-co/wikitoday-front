## Southeast Asia's View on US-China Relations and the Importance of Trilateral Cooperation

_2023-08-04 - wikitoday_

The US-China relationship has been a subject of discussion and concern in Southeast Asia. Many countries in the region view the US as provocative and believe that the trend is towards demonizing China. Instead, they emphasize the importance of maintaining a neutral stance and benefiting from both superpowers. Unlike South Korea, which has taken a more activist role against China, Southeast Asian countries, particularly those associated with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), have shown that the US administration's policy of containment and pressure is not effective in winning their hearts and minds. They see the US strategy of dividing the world into democracies and autocracies and narrowing the circle of public support through the Indo-Pacific strategy as reflecting a new Cold War. The Asia Society, a New York-based nonprofit organization, has published a report titled 'Southeast Asia Should Be Prioritized in U.S. Public Policy.' The report highlights the importance of Southeast Asia and its undervalued position in US interests and public rivalries. It recommends policy changes to the US government and calls for a response to China's growing influence in the region. Southeast Asia is the geopolitical heart of the Indo-Pacific region, with vital trade arteries and strategic importance.

However, the region is wary of being drawn into the US-China rivalry and sees the US as overreacting in its containment efforts. They do not adopt the US-proposed 'free and open' Indo-Pacific strategy as they perceive it as forcing the region into a geopolitical framework. Trilateral cooperation between the US, South Korea, and Japan is seen as critical in dealing with China's increasing aggression. Congressman French Hill emphasized the importance of this cooperation in maintaining economic prosperity and promoting freedom in the Indo-Pacific region. The three countries need to work together to ensure the freedom of trade and navigation, counter China's neocolonial Belt and Road strategy, and uphold peace and prosperity in the region and around the world. The upcoming trilateral summit between the US, South Korea, and Japan demonstrates the commitment to stronger collaboration and marks an important step towards addressing the challenges posed by China's assertiveness. In conclusion, Southeast Asia's view on US-China relations underscores the desire for a neutral stance and the importance of benefiting from both superpowers. Trilateral cooperation between the US, South Korea, and Japan is also seen as crucial in managing China's growing aggression. As the region navigates the complex dynamics between the US and China, maintaining a balanced approach and fostering multilateral partnerships will be key to ensuring peace and prosperity.
