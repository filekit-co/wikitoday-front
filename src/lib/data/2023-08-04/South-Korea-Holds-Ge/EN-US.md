## South Korea Holds Germany to a 1-1 Draw in Women's World Cup Group H

_2023-08-04 - wikitoday_

The South Korean women's national football team scored a first-half goal for the first time in World Cup history against Germany in their final Group H match of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup at Brisbane Stadium in Australia on August 3, but conceded a late equalizer to settle for a 1-1 draw. South Korea took a 1-0 lead when Cho So-hyun opened the scoring with a precise right-footed strike in the sixth minute, but Germany's captain and goalkeeper Alexandra Pope equalized in the 42nd minute to level the match.

With South Korea looking to secure a point in the group stage and Germany facing elimination, both teams played more attacking soccer in the second half in an attempt to secure a victory, but the match ended 1-1. South Korea (ranked 17th in the FIFA rankings) finished last in Group H with a 1-1 draw, but unlike four years ago in France when they finished with three losses, they finished the tournament with a valuable point.
