Despite his condition, he continued to work as a photographer and maintained a strong bond with Bullock and her children. The family expressed their immense gratitude to the doctors and nurses who provided care, often sacrificing their own personal lives to be there for Randall. In their statement, they requested privacy during this difficult time and thanked everyone for their support.

 In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the ALS Association and the Massachusetts General Hospital. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig&#39;s disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. There is currently no cure for ALS, and the disease typically worsens over time.
