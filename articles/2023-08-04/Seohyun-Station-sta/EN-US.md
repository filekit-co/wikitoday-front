_2023-08-04 - wikitoday_

On the afternoon of the 3rd, a 'don't ask, don't tell' stabbing incident occurred at a large shopping mall near Seohyeon Station in Bundang, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do. A police car enters the area near the incident site on the morning of the 4th. Photo by Lim Hyung-taek On the morning of the 4th, Hong Mo (25), a resident of Paju City, Gyeonggi Province, came across a video of the Seohyeon Station weapon rampage while browsing social media. The video showed the suspect walking around with a knife at the crime scene. 'I didn't want to watch it, but I ended up watching it,' Ms. Hong said, adding, 'There are a lot of posts, so I keep seeing it over and over again.' 'I feel depressed because I only see horrible news,' he said, adding, 'I won't look at social media for a while.' On the afternoon of the 3rd, a 'don't ask, don't tell' weapon rampage took place at a large shopping mall near Seohyeon Station in Bundang, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do. Police are controlling the scene. Photo by Lim Hyung-taek Recently, citizens have been complaining about the inconvenience of being forced to watch videos of a series of stabbing incidents. The problem is that they are often forced to watch them on social media even if they don't want to.Since the night of the 3rd of this month, photos of the scene of Seohyeon Station, where Abi Gyu-hwan was found, have been posted one after another on various social media. Seohyeon Station is an everyday space with a large number of people and is often used as a meeting place. The photos show a devastating scene where all traces of everyday life have disappeared. The unconscious bodies of the victims and the blood-soaked scene were nakedly visible. It's not hard to find photos that have not been sensationalized, edited, or mosaicked. A quick Instagram search for the hashtag 'stabbing' yields more than 1,000 posts.Short-form video content was also created, so it's not hard to find footage of the attack if you're willing to look.

The video shows a black hooded assailant charging at a group of people with a weapon. The video shows the perpetrator wielding the weapon, as well as his mugshot. Some of the posts were intentionally inflammatory in order to attract users' attention. 'This is so horrible,' 'I don't want to see this,' and 'I feel sick to my stomach,' were some of the reactions to the shocking video. Some citizens were traumatized by the brutal video. 'I'm scared because I keep watching the video of the incident and feel like it's no one else's business,' said my aunt (26, female, office worker) in Wonju, Gangwon Province. 'Crazy X is everywhere, and the province is no exception. I feel like someone will suddenly enter my office and stab me with a knife.' My aunt, a 25-year-old female office worker in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, said, 'I keep seeing videos and imagining all sorts of things,' and complained of a 'strong sense of fear.' Last year's Itaewon tragedy also became a problem when photos and videos from the scene were shared online. However, there are no 'guidelines' for photos and videos. Short-form videos are especially problematic because they auto-play even if you don't choose to watch them, forcing users to watch them even if they don't want to. 'During the Itaewon tragedy, there were a lot of photos and videos of the scene,' one user wrote, 'and it looks like it will be there for a while. 'Usually, trauma is experienced by the individual or when it happens to a close family member,' said Baek Jong-woo, a professor of psychiatry at Kyung Hee University, 'but nowadays, as the quality of photos and videos has improved and it is easier to obtain videos, more and more people are complaining of severe traumatic pain directly.' 'Repeatedly viewing footage of the event can lead to symptoms such as anxiety and insomnia,' he said. 'The younger the age, the greater the impact. 'The younger you are, the more it affects you. The negative impact on teenagers is greater,' he warned.It is expected to be difficult to punish under the current law even if the video is distributed. 'These photos and videos are more for the purpose of publicizing the scene,' said Choi Jin-nyeong, a lawyer at CK Law Firm. 'If they are not intended to cause sexual humiliation or slander, it is difficult to punish them as cyber defamation.' 'It is an ongoing problem,' he said of the spread of horrific scenes online, 'and it is necessary to legislate through social discussion, such as whether or not to criminally punish them.
