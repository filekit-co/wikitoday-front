<div class="article-body">
The identity and mugshot of 22-year-old Choi Won-jong, the suspect in the Seohyeon Station stabbing rampage that killed one person and injured 13 others, was released yesterday. Along with the mugshot, a photo of his arrest was also released, but like Choi Choi, the suspect in the Shinlim-dong stabbing, he refused to be photographed for a mugshot. The name and face of the suspect who left 14 people dead in a frenzied car and weapon rampage over the past three days has been released.

 It&#39;s Choi Won-jong, a 22-year-old man. The Police Identity Disclosure Review Committee stated, &#39;The brutality of the crime and the gravity of the damage are recognized in light of the fact that he attacked citizens in a public place and tried to kill several people. The public interest in reducing public unrest and preventing similar crimes was also recognized.

 In response to criticisms that the suspect&#39;s photo was different from his current appearance, the police released another photo of Choi Won-jong, this time with his mugshot, showing how he looked when he was arrested. Choi Won-jong, with his hair shaved short, also looked very different from his previous mugshot, but he refused to be photographed for a mugshot shortly after his arrest. Police believe he may have planned the crime in advance, as he searched keywords such as &#39;Shinlim Station incident&#39; and &#39;weapon&#39; before the attack.

As for his motive, Choi Won-jong maintains that he committed the crime because he thought there were many groups stalking him at Seohyeon Station. In response, the police conducted a psychopath diagnostic test, the results of which will be available in about a week. At the scene of the incident, citizens paid tribute to the woman in her 60s who died.

 [Choi Moon-ho/Memorialist] &#39;My heart is very heavy. Because this could have happened to me.
