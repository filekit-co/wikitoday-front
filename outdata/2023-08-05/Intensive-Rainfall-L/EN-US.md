It's been almost three weeks since torrential rains caused major damage in northern Gyeongsangbuk-do. Gyeongsangbuk-do believes that disasters that may or may not come once in 50 or 100 years will become more frequent in the future, and is taking this opportunity to prepare a solid alternative. The emergency restoration rate for this intensive rainfall is 89.8% overall, including 98.2% for roads and bridges. Now that emergency restoration is in its final stages, attention is shifting to port restoration and preventive measures.

Gyeongsangbuk-do is taking action through the Landslide Response System Innovation Task Force, saying the heavy rains have shown that there are no safe zones. It plans to build disaster prevention villages that can prevent landslides, and will begin a large-scale safety diagnosis of risk factors such as artificial objects in the mountains. In addition, we will improve the warning, evacuation, and rescue and relief systems so that rapid dissemination and evacuation can be carried out in actual situations. With extreme weather events such as extreme downpours becoming an everyday occurrence, the extent of the damage will depend on how well we establish permanent recovery plans and disaster preparedness.
